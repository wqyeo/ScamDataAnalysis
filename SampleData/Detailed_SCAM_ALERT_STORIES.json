I replied 'no' but she replied immediately, almost like it was automated, asking that I should read the job details first, give her two mins etc.... I said I have a job already. she replied, again very quickly saying essentially the same thing but phrased differently. I was thinking, she asked me if I’m interested and asked me to read the job details first, like three times, but she never sent me any details. I guess she was waiting for me to say “yes.” And so I decided to have fun and said I’m only interested in selling bubble tea. And she proceeded to curse me and called me names, and sent my Telegram profile photo to me which creeped me out. I replied saying wow, so polite you, I’m sure you get many recruits. Again she called me names, and proceeded to block me, after which the whole thread was gone. I regret not screenshotting. Oh, she also sprinkled a few of those smiling emojis with hearts on it..that was before she turned all psycho."

                "Description": "I was contacted by a recruiter from 'BGC Group' called Julie and she referred me to the job in-Charge known as ChongLin.Chonglin then introduced to me that the job was to boost sellers' listings just by clicking 2 buttons. The job involves completing 45 sets of lisitings and I will receive commission for each listing I have completed. The listings are categorized into 2 types: normal and enterprise. Normal does not require deposits while Enterprise requires deposits. At first, when an enterprise data pops up, chonglin will lead by asking me to contact the customer service whatsapp account to request for a bank account to deposit money. He also explained that I could take out my principal on top of my commissions. Afterwards, he even showed a screenshot of his transaction to gain my trust.The next day when I tried, there were much more enterprise lisitings. Each listings requires more and more money to deposit in order to complete the lisiting. Being led on by chonglin, i did not doubt much and continued to deposit until I realise I do not have sufficient funds to do so. Thats when I asked from help and they asked me to borrow from my friends and family. Its was only when I told my sister and I found out it was a scam. I lost about 11k at this point. I reported to the bank and police later on in the same day.Here are some of the key takeaways from my incident:1) Do not trust any online messages claiming to be a recruiter2) There should always be company funds to perform business operations. So even if the party seems reliable and convincing, do not trust him/her to make deposits3) Just because there is a group chat for your work, means your job us real. Though not mention above, I was being added to a whatsapp group chat. I believed their tactics to make you think it is legitimate. They also purposefully gain your trust by having other scammers acting as newbies to ask questions you would be interested in to gain your trust.4) It is obvious that it is a scammer organization, with one loop after another to get you trapped in this scam.5) Always question everything you see online, no matter how reliable it may seem.6) When you find it suspicious, always trust ur instinct, stop what you are doing and verify. Do not be led on by the scammers.I hope my painful lesson will help to spread awareness and prevent less people from falling prey to such scams again. :)"

I feel that he is aggressive. knowing that i am single and available, he tried to win my heart; in one week he wrote 3 emails: about himself, write me a poem, and telling me a detailed story about how his ex wife cheated on him. Honestly his email and chats made me wonder if this could be real.. luckily one of several friends whom I shared about this told me sternly that this definitely is a love scam. so I already signed out my hangouts. if he emailed me again, i may just ignore it or told him off. I am thankful that i am spared from further lies/loss. after realising that I am his prey, I could recall more and more parts that are odd. I cannot comprehend why people can be so wicked.the evil is really there outside, beware!"

I told him not to send the package over and wait for him to return but he insisted to send over. I asked what he sent over, but he refuse to say.

I started questioning him and asked why would he want to send a large package. We are not even close friends. He told me that i have to pay a custom clearance fee of sgd3000 when the shipment arrived. he knew i am not going to pay that amount and he offer to put some money in the package. Okay, finally got notified by the courier that shipment has arrived. I trusted him initially and proceed to make a initial payment of sgd3000. I was given this account to bank in the cash.

It was 8.30am on Monday and i was about to reach the office so reluctantly confirmed my name and IC (and nothing else).I was then told a story about a summons for a phone bill unpaid for 2 years.  i was then told the fake number and that the phone was registered in my name.  I was then told there was a connected case being investigated by China Interpol.  this was regarding a suspect named Tan Fue Yi who had been detained in Beijing with a bundle of ATM cards and one of them has my name on it.   i was told she is suspected of money laundering and that i should cooperate with Singapore Interpol to clear my name and help the Chinese with their investigation.  I was then given a case number and transferred to supposedly Interpol where an officer introduced himself as officer CAVIN who requested me to confirm my IC and name and provide case number and details of the case (the story I'd just been told)  in order to record my version of events for the record.  He then requested to meet him at Interpol with my IC and passport to sign my report and for him to escort me to the Chinese embassy to assist investigations.  again this was urgent and he suggested i try to meet him within the hour.  about 90 minutes later I arrived at Interpol to be informed there is no officer Cavin and to report this scam to the local police."

So I called this contact and a man (Indian accent ) received and ask my phone number for technician to return call and hang up.

He explained how I got the trojan virus and the location which need repair and after repairing (as she claimed) she said that i required to download 4 x firewall programme for banking, mobile, credit card and online purchase. I agreed and she request that i login in to my internet banking so she could copy the address/url address. That is time i realised that i might be scam so i faked stomach ache to go to toilet. I notified DBS immediately to delete internet banking account and all credit cards. After confirming all account/cards deleted i re-engaged the scammer and was instructed again to login into my internet banking (she can see what i'm doing ) which I can't log into. She requested for my credit card and cvv no and after she requested me to gave her a active credit card no and i told her that all my credit cards and internet banking had been deleted. She asked me why I deleted all these, which i explained that you might be a scammer. She told me that she will called later and hanged up.

Because i thought it was too suspicious and did not divulge any confidential information.I did not continue the conversation upon having suspicions."

The person was able to address my daughter by her name and informed her that her I/C was used to issue a credit card which was sent to an address in Bukit Timah. There was a payment of almost $10,000 due tomorrow. She started to panic and at that point, she was transferred to a 'police officer'. At that point, she came to me and gave me the phone and i spoke to that 'officer'. Initially, there were no red flags and the policeman I spoke to spoke English with a Singaporean accent and sounded genuine. He asked me to come down to the cantonment branch to make a report and when i asked if i can make a report in my neighbourhood police post, he agreed. After the call, when i spoke to my daughter, i realised it was a +65 number and so could be a spam call. I called the bank and asked them to check if a credit card was issued since we had the card number and they said no. I also called the spoofed number and the person who picked up said he was not from the bank.Please be careful as this seems to be a new type of scam and the people speaking don't speak with obvious accents, so it sounded like a very genuine call."

She started the conversation but will soon divert the conversation to wechat, asking me to add her.She will share that she’s someone who travels around often maintaining her trading business based in guangzhou shenzhen. She will come off as someone who is financially capable, emphasizing her knowledge in investing as a side business to maintain the high standard of livings there.For the first few days, she would attempt to phish for personal information (location, salary, interest, investment knowledge, close relatives). Slowly, the conversation will progress to how she and her friend invest during their free time and earning fast bucks. Never in the conversation would she encourage you to join in investing, nor would she ask you to lend her money. When you ask for more info, she would offer her help for free to teach you how to invest. Next, she would direct you to this 'trading platform' (ccysu?.com), which shows a dashboard with various currency exchange and a crypto-coin. She asked to set up an account, and from there will send you another wechat account (trading platform support contact), asking you to seek advice from there for information of transfer of funds to the platform. The platform consultant will then send you a local account information of transfer of funds. Sometimes another account number will be given if the you mentioned the transferring amount is substantial. Platform consultant as sop will direct you a company's link and prove that they are a global customer. A smart move so that if anything happens, the blame would be on the platform, not the girl. 3) personal info, money, time and effort all will be lost if one is to fall for this trap. I can only assume that you can 'trade' on the platform for the first couple of days or weeks since the scammer is only asking for a small amount of money to be invested initially. The platform is fake, so an easily manipulated bear chart will have you keep buying in for cost averaging down, unknowingly pumping in more money to the 'platform'.To add, I believe is critical to continue the conversation even when realising that it is a scam. This way, counter scamming would enable us to phish more details from scammers and their operating sop. To that end of course never transfer any money or personal info to achieve it.Scammer's details;ZhenXi9203 (WeChat)/ ZhenXi (Tinder)/ Chenxi951126 (WeChat)/  (www.cnyi?.com)/  (www.ccysu?.com)Bank Account Number: Standard Chartered Bank (??07909626) - Tan Mei Gi | OCBC Bank (??4-139398-001)SGD / (??4-146906-201)USD - Zeng Zhi Min"

Then he told me to pay S$300 at the AXS machine via alipay top-up. AFter that he asked for more, giving other excuses. I felt fishy after paying 3k. I wanted to stop but he sort of threaten me. Once I've left the vicinity, the girl contacted me and then showed gruesome video of they threatening. In the end I was too gullible and pay another 5k worth of google playstore card.  Unfortunately, I can't write much as I'm limit to 500 words. I can go all day long and list every details of how they scam and what kind of excuses given. I found out that the girls are around HK and they somehow manage to spoof their location in Singapore. Don't trust any girls providing LINE ID in dating apps. (eg, tinder, CMB, etc).Editor's Note: Police have shared that at least S$295,000 was lost to credit-for-sex scams in March this year, with about 112 reports lodged. We advised MOPs to be wary of such scams during this Covid-19 period as scammers are not taking a break during this period. Also, a gentle reminder that members of the public are to stay home and avoid going out during the “circuit breaker” period.https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/sex-scams-police-online-wechat-tinder-michat-locanto-skokka-12651698"

I told him i prefer to pay by credit card. he said there is already a pending credit card payment. i then asked for the last 4 digits of the credit card number. he said he will email me the details and i have to enter 6 pin number to open it. i refused and insisted he tells me over the phone. he lost his patience and said to me 'you just come down to amazon office to give me a bxxx job and I will tell you the number'. he wasn't even able to tell me amazon office address nor phone number but instead asking me to google for it.This scammer also spoofed a mobile number, so i called back that number, it turned out to be an invalid number"

Subsequently claimed he loved me, wanted his future wife to be able to manage wealth etc. One day he asked if i was busy, i replied no. But when i did not reply his message he got insecure and defensive. He claimed wanted me to practice trading hands on, made me download trading app 'dtcoin' (not found in app store), create an account. Told me to contact customer service to ask what was the minimum deposit (sgd1000). Told him i did not have that much, he pestered and ask if i really didn't want to invest that night (he claims good profit). Since he was earning thousands everyday, i asked if he could lend me $1000 to trade then i return him the money once i earn my profits - he said to think of alternatives. Next day, he asked if i was able to come up with the money (claims small amount), then said that my circle of friends is too small, i didn't know the importance of money etc. Told him i trust my religion and not money, am comfortable with what i have now. He was upset and became nasty.Signed up using a mobile phone number, have since deleted the app. Looks suspicious as it requires an id number to be a verified member. Searched the line id on instagram, one account came up with the same name. However, the guy looks different from what he sent."

I am not able to withdraw the money if I haven't complete 40 target. When i do the top up i feel there is something wrong with it and I stopped and asked the money back and the lady said I'm not able to withdraw as I didn't finish the target as a result my money stuck there and not able to get back. Beside that they will add u into a WhatsApp group, inside have about 8 ppl which I think all are scammers, they will post their achievements or how much they earn in the group to mislead you into continuing to top up your money."

I didn't think much and just gave him the code.After 15 minutes, i asked him why he needed to ask me so many questions (e.g. Do you know someone who lives in australia?, what is the name of your bank?) To cancel the order. I then went on the lazada website and realized that with just my email address and my phone number, he could click on 'forgot password?' and log in with just the 6-digit code. I hope Lazada will change this. I then realized it was a scam and hung up.The scammer tried to call me back with the following numbers: +65 9781 2304 and +65 9750 1009. He had an indian accent. He probably got my email address and phone number from an online database.Luckily, there was no saved card details in my account so he didn't manage to pay for the 2 pairs of nike shoes he ordered from my account.I then called Lazada. They confirmed it was a scam and that the scammer won't be able to complete the orders without my card numbers.In the end, i only lost some personal information (full name, birthday, old addresses) but it's only because i was lucky that i didn't have any saved card details in this Lazada account.Editor's note: Never share OTPs of any accounts with anyone. By releasing these OTPs, you are giving the 'key' of the account to scammers."

The Credit for Sex Scammers usually don't have a local number tied to their advertisement, instead they will use a Line-ID or a WeChat-ID. The only way to connect with them is via these apps. They can advertise their services on Locanto, or Tinder or any other possible websites. The one I experienced was via Locanto, and was directed to add this person on WeChat.Upon contacting the 'masseuse' or the 'escort', they will pretend it is a legitimate proposition by asking you when you would like to meet them. Once you have given them a date and a time, they will ask for your location. The location I was given was “102 Yishun Avenue 5”. Upon arriving at the location, the girl will request for you to take a picture of your surroundings to indicate you have reached the meeting place. Next, they will ask you for your contact number so that their “friend” can contact you with further instructions and direct you to their actual location.Once you have given your contact number, their friend will call you via an Unknown or Private number, and ask you a series of questions. The questions asked will be whether or not this is your first time with this girl and if you have any friends or family who are in the police force. Once they have verified that this is your first time and that you do not have any connections to the police, this is when they will proceed with the scam. He will then ask you to pay a deposit of $100 or $200 for the services which you requested via an AXS machine, selecting the Top Up – Alipay option with their e-mail given to you by the girl via the messaging app. This is the first red flag! Once you have done so, you will be requested by the girl to take a picture of the receipt and send via the app. Next, the “friend” will then ask you to make a “refundable deposit” of $1,200 as this is their company policy. They will justify it by saying that the girl is a student and is doing this illegally, the money will be used to bail them out in the event they are caught and deported back. Do not transfer the money! Second red flag!Once you have rejected transferring the money, he will begin to threaten you by saying he have your contact number and will track you down and hurt your family. They will then negotiate with you by asking you to make a smaller amount for deposit. The girl will even call you on the messaging app to plead with you that it is for your safety. Stay calm! This is all a scam. Stop topping up nor deposit any more money and report to the police."

                "Description": "I met this guy who calls himself jin on Instagram. He said he is a Singaporean working and living in USA. WithIn 1 week, he professed his love and admiration. We could get along really well and he was very sweet, UNDERSTANDing and encouraging. We exchanged many photos and he knows about my 2 children. He claims to have one child who is 4 years old and is divorced. As I am going through a divorce myself, it was a match. We chatted every day for close to 2 months. He said he is coming back to Singapore to see me and we will plan a life together.He said his boss needs him to go to belgium for work before he can come back to SG.he is suppose to buy some machinery. On the 6th day of being in belgium, he was going to buy the machine but left his company card at home in USA. Then he realised he cannot use his personal card. Neither can he wire money over to the seller via internet banking . He couldn't ask others or his boss because he didnt want to look incompetent. So he asked for my help - by logging in to his account from Sg and transfer the money to my bank account before transferring it to belgium. Somehow the transfer didnt go through to me. All this while my red flags were up. I did a check on his bank and it seems fake. I also did a photo reverse check on him. I found that he has stolen someone Else's profile and pictures. He is not who he said he was. I blocked him on Instagram and deleted our chat on Google hangout after confronting him. He has since shut down his IG account."

After a few days, he introduced me to a way of investing with high return (90%) and offered to guide me on how to do it. I decided to just give it a try to see how it work. He asked me to download an app from an external link and create an account. He also asked me to use Huobi Global to buy cryptocurrency to transfer to bjs app. He gave me the customer service number for quicker response. It was actually option trading with cryptocurrency. For my first trade, I did earn money and able to withdraw my whole amount from the app. He encouraged me to continue invest into the b?s platform. On my third topup, the customer service intro the top-up activity to me which include free gifts or cash. He also lured me to join in the activity by offering to help share half of the topup amount. After joining the activity, I could not take out the money. Customer service said I need to top up to the amount in order to withdraw. However after I hit the amount, there were still various “taxes” to pay. I realised I was scammed when he blocked me after that. After this I also realised that his IG photos were stolen from a Weibo user."

But later he told me that the transfer is not success as he need to pay usd 8300 to his bank so that money transfer will be success. Then i realize that i got scammed. So i called my bank about it and bank told me to file a police case so they can take note that transfer is scam. His mobile no is +447537130091."

Her number is +60 11-6441 6088.We chatted for a few days to understand each other until one day she asked me if I'm interested to invest. She promised me she will guide me along and very confident every transaction will be successful. She kept on persuading me and send me a link to install the app. It's a APK file, app named 'KRX'. The app uses USD only and in order to deposit you will need to contact customer service via WhatsApp. Deposit via account number or paynow. KRX number is +852 5535 2443. After downloading the app, I created an account. She told me to deposit US $100 equivalent to SG $135 to give it a try. She began persuading me to deposit US $1000/SG $1350. Since I did 'earn', I decided to be greedy and deposit SG $1350. She told me she willing to 'lend' me US $6000, so I took it. She also told me to message her my KRX account number so she can transfer the US $6000 to me. At this point, I trusted her completely as all the transactions she guided me were successful. I began to deposit more and more money. On the day of Christmas, I decided to withdraw all my money out and return her US $6000 equivalent to SG $8100 as we agree on it. I questioned her the withdrawal procedure and she answered me if my account is less than US $20000, you will need to contact customer service and if US $20000 or more, it can be done by yourself on the app. I contacted the customer service for withdrawal as my account only have around US $15000/over SG $20000. Customer service text me saying it is required to pay the cross border fee, 20% of the total sum and is fully refundable after the withdrawal completes. She started pestering me to return her US $6000 she lend me or else she will lodge a report on the app and make a police report. I got scared and paid the 20% cross border fee so that I could get all my money back and return her. Customer service message me saying it takes about 30 minutes to process. About 15 minutes later, I received a message from customer service saying a user report me, therefore withdrawal process has stopped. At this point, I know it is all a scam and make a police report. Later that day she message me to return her money but I ignored her.In total I lost $12643 in 3 days. From investment to nightmare. WORST CHRISTMAS EVER.⚠️ If you are a victim of a scam, please DO NOT attempt to be a scammer or money mule in order to recover back your losses ⚠️"

This kind of scam is called 杀猪盘 in china. You guys can go baidu it and will have more horror scam stories. Please share with your family/peers/friends/relatives because you will never know if they are going to be the next victim-to-be. This can happened to female and male so just take note! These are the signs 1. Their introduction/bio will be quite short or very sweet. E.g 我相信一见钟情 that kind of bull shit. They will also state that they are in singapore for a short work trip or etc. 2. They will put selfie in their profile so you kinda believe that they are 'real'. However, they aren't! They are cat fishing and probably take those pictures from online. 3. Talk in wechat/telegram/whatsapp normally, after a while, they will ask you to talk in wechat/whatsapp/telegram. I guess it is easier for them to reply after all... They need to reply to 101 potential victims. 4.they are sweet at talking and make you feel awwwww! 5. Talk about finances/investment and show you their winnings. Sometimes, they will talk about finances/investment or what adults should be financially independent to have a better future. They will start to show you their winnings and tempt you to join them 6. You don't need to transfer him money at all, just create an account 7. The scammer will make you believe that you are earning and able to withdraw the earnings (i read from baidu) and put in more money and more money. Then one day 'puff' they mia. After my incident happened, i tried to google online for this scam in singapore but i couldn't seem to find any cases. Back then, i didn't know that it is call 杀猪盘 either so i did not read up more. I did told some of my friends and one of them (their friend friend friend - super distant) had this encounter as well. I believe there are some people who might have gotten scammed but did not voice up or don't know where to voice up. With the recent increasing china profile in dating apps, i really urged everyone to inform their loved ones and friends - not to fall for it! It is really sad to get scammed. With that, i hope everyone stay safe and becareful in both offline and online world!"

Soon after, I was contacted on WhatsApp and provided with a website detailing the company and a job portal.Two accounts were created, the first being one for my own use, the second by the person whom I was speaking to. After topping-up the second account, they directed me to complete the tasks to generate data. By example, there was a need to top up the account every time it reached a negative amount. She would top up the account by direct me to contact customer service with the top-up details.Upon completing the tasks, she withdrew the amount from the account and sent the amount to the first account that had been made for my own use. I was then directed to complete the tasks on the account where I proceeded to do the same and successfully withdrew a portion of the money. (28/12/21).The next day (29/12/21), the same person contacted me. Following the same steps, I completed the steps on her account first.Things started getting worse when I started using my own account. The amounts kept getting bigger and when I consulted the person about these amounts, she continued to encourage me to keep going so that I could withdraw the full amount once the tasks were complete.I contacted customer service and questioned them, stating that if I did not get the money back, I would lodge a police report. They replied that they had an army of lawyers that would counter the claims. After some back and forth, I was told that a manager would be calling me.During the call, their manager requested we top up a final amount to off-set the negative on the account so that the order could be completed. Including the amount that was supposed to be deposited, I was supposed to receive the total plus commission once the transfer was complete. I agreed to this after requesting some details as assurance from the manager.Once I had fulfilled the top-up, I waited before going to check the status of the account. This was when the manager called me again, yelling at me to ask me what I did, only to find that there was now a new order on the account and that the negative amount on the account was back even larger than the last. They claimed that this had never happened before and said that I had done something. I did not even have my phone with me because I had it on the charger at the time the transaction was made.I noticed a HP advertisement on their website earlier which is why I thought the company had some legitimacy to it. A friend that I consulted went to do some research and found that the company was using an expired marketing quote without consent. She has said that HP will now be reporting the company because the comment expired 4 years ago."

How it works is that I have to help the person who referred me to grab 40 orders first then go to my account and finish 40 orders before i can withdraw money. Sometimes i will have to recharge/top up the account with my own money by contacting their 'customer service' (+65 8912 4534) which random bank accounts will be given each day or will change every now and then. When i withdraw, all top up and commission will be sent to my bank account. I only did this for a day but it was already very sketchy. On the first day i earned $70+, $130+ if inclusive of my top-up amount, the second day i was super skeptical when they asked me to top up close to $400 so i stopped. Thank goodness i only made a $40 loss. I see some other agents in the group chat recharging 1k+ into their account but I'm not convinced. I read up on some scams on order grabbing and am still not sure if this is a legitimate business. Please beware of random job offers especially if it requires a deposit from your own account."

Obviously, they operate in China which is evident also from massively ungrammatical emails sent.2)\t16 Jan 2019. A package from the company arrived at my address. The package contained two pairs of fake imitation Rayban sunglasses instead of my samsonite bag order. The condition of the glasses is massively used with scratches and a huge scarp on one of the glasses. I emailed the company on the same day to enquire about the wrong delivery. On the same day, the company returned an email claiming that they had diligently checked the package and it was the fault of the express company (courier) in mixing up the order. This is not possible as the package was in its primary packaging 2 fake Rayban boxes without further external packaging). Which goes to say that when the package was in its original packaging when the company passed the parcel to their courier. Hence, it is not possible to be the mistake of your courier. Furthermore, as indicated on the package labelling, it clearly states that it is a handbag 手提包，which goes to say that person packing would have known the contents when he packed it.3)\t17 Jan 2019. The company emailed me again further expressing the fault of the express company offering a 20% refund as compensation and a “big discount and nice gift on the next order”. They also mentioned that should I want to have my original goods sent back to them, I would have to bear another US$25 and I would have to wait longer for my original order to be sent. 4)\t18 Jan 2019. I sent an email stating evidence to the scam. It reads as follow:The modus operandi of the scam online website is obvious: Offer more than 50% of selling price on the website to entice potential victims. Upon receipt of order, they will send out low cost and light weight items pretending that the items were mistakenly sent out by the courier. When they get a response from their victims, they will ‘force’ their customers to send back the item which would incur additional costs which no one would since there is no guarantee that their order will be correctly sent back thus profiting from their scheme."

He stated that my phone line will be cut off within the next 2 hours because someone created another number with singtel using my particulars. I was told to contact the chinese investigative bureau, a chinese number, and clarify with them so that my line will not be cut. When i called the chinese investigative bureau, they said that a 57 yo man was swindling money by creating fake accounts under my name and phone number in china, and to be sure that i was no relation to the man, they required me to answer questions while the call was recorded. It made the whole situation seem very real because the fake officer was calling other investigative authorities to bring up my case files, etc. i had to declare with my name, and nric. They asked me personal information on my family and living circumstances. The call ended saying they will continue the investigation and contact me through watsapp, plus i was to update them my location at 5pm and 8pm. I was also not to divulge any of information of the case to anyone or they would be implicated into the investigation. the next day, the fake officer called me again saying they had new evidences of my involvement in the case, they even sent me a certificate of the bank accounts created in hong kong, with my chinese name and nric stated. In order to clear my name of any involvement, i was to either fly to hong kong, paying for my own air ticket, and meet with the officers there, or to transfer money to them and freeze my accounts. Thats when i realised that i was a part of a scam because no official would waste 4 hours of talking to you over the phone and subsequently asking you to transfer money or asking for personal bank details. I hung up saying that i would not transfer any money or reveal my bank accounts. Subsequently, i called the singapore police hotline to make a report."

Finally Ninja van will show up on your door and will hand over a sealed packed and demand cash. they will caution you if you open the packet it is consider receipt of delivery hence you are obligated to pay money. however if you do not open, you will establish the facts of fraud later. i got trapped and my wife (at home) paid the amount, however after opening the packet, i REALIZED that product is nowhere close what was advertised. hence i called immediately ninja van team and told them that the product is fake. There are many customers who have received the same packet and reached out to 'Ninja Van team' to ensure their cash is not paid to seller and they shall be able to protect customer from this fraud. but they flatly refused me & others and informed me that as soon as i signed the delivery slip they remitted the money to seller. Hence, I asked them to share the details of seller name, account number and requested them to raise the matter and inform local AUTHORITIES. there did not share any details nor shown any concern about the money lost by multiple customers, which made me believe they are either part of fraud or may be creator of fraud. how can a company send instant payment to an unknown seller and that to INSTANTANEOUSLY, hard to digest this. Here are the symptoms you must check:1. Great price deal - Check reputation of online seller2.

But then they told me that their system 'sometimes' uses a round off system which they did not inform me before i confirmed my full refund amount with them and so they said my account was locked as a result, and they tried making me pay another 8k to unlock my account but no I decided to call my bank and lodge a police report immediately.Heard from someone else in the group they could make you pay up to 16k just to get your refund back but that's crazy."

He only text u & refuses to meet up in person or let u go to his office. He tells u it is approved & wants to disburse the next day. Then, he asked for several thousands to deposit into their new account, which he promised will be returned when they disburse the loan. After the transfers are done, he tells you that he forgets to collect GST from you. He insisted it has to be paid before the loan disbursement. 7% or S$21000. I asked for invoice & GST number of his company. Bearing in mind, i still don't know if it was company or personal private loan. He assured me i will get the agreement & GST invoice. When the 4 page loan agreement came, I had already transferred the full 'GST' of $21,000.00 to some dodgy personal accounts. Meantime, still no deposits. Next day, he called to inform Boss wants me to pay $15,000.00 premiums for insurance cover. At this point, i realised i had been conned. They just wanted me to send money to them every day with no intention of giving me the loan.By this time, I had parted $30,000+. I refused to pay the insurance unless the loan is disbursed to me. They resorted to thugs to harass my phone & my husband too. They even sent videos of paints splashings on other house & threatened to visit my home. Just be aware, I did not get a single cent, lost $30,000, and they wanted me to pay them $15,000.00. What did they do? Outright scamming, on the pretext of offering cheap loans. Pure gangsters.

For English conversation, press 1; for Mandarin, press 2.” Days before I pressed 1 and 2 but there was no response.Today I received the call again and pressed 2, and a man talked with me. Here is the conversation of the 1st call:“Please tell me your name.”[I provided my name and spelled it]“Ok, There is two things to inform you. Firstly, how many doses did you vaccinated?”[Two doses, I said]“You have to take the third and forth dose of vaccination. I will sign up for you, you can go to nearby clinic to be vaccinated.”“Your voice is blurry, are you stay in home or outside?”[I am in shopping mall now, I said]“Are you hanging out with friends?”[with friends, I said]“When would you go back to home? I’ll contact you later while it will take some time to verify your documents.”[About 5:00pm, I said]“5:00pm is the time we get off work …but I think it is ok. My name is Li Guoyou, please remember this name since I will contact you again.”[OK, and I think I will go back to home more quickly and 4:30pm is ok to receive a call. I said]“Ok.”Here is the conversation of 2nd call:“I am Li Guoyou from the Ministry of Health, and the second thing is an important Covid-19 notification. However, we are still verifying your documents. Could I call you tomorrow?”[No problems, I have spare time all the time tomorrow. I said]“Then I will call you at 8:15am. Would it disturb your morning exercise or else plan?”[No it won’t. I said.]“Ok, I will call you tomorrow. Sorry for taking your time.”[Thank you.

I transferred $250, but could only withdraw $100 at the end of the day. The remaining $150 is used for next day orders. However, it is not enough and i will have to reload again. Which means i will have to input more money into the system. Since i can only withdraw $100 a day, it will mean that i cannot fully withdraw everything subsequently. The amount just gets bigger and bigger, and i will not get money back. Person who hired me has contact number 8167 154?, website 'customer service' number is 8203181?."

I bought 5 pieces meant as gifts for friends and family. so what happened was that the items arrived, you would pay the courier in cash, and then when you inspect the items, they were clearly not originals (much less from the official store at changi airport) and of an inferior quality (like those on the street stalls of bangkok), with suspicious packaging. So naturally you would email the company and asked for a refund, but they would stall for time, claiming that they are transacting while an agent, and the agent will require 3-5 weeks to process the refund. After 6 weeks when I tried to contact them again, as there had been no news from the 'agent', they would already cease operations completely and no longer respond to messages. $83 for a lesson learned (including not being opportunistic and greedy), but I hope no one falls into this trick again as this is clearly cheating (fake advertising, etc) ."

Till I knew something not right and decided to end everything. He blocked me FROM LINe after ALL things happened. Ladies out there,  beware of guy u never meet and not to trust THEM too much."

Agreed to give her my number so employer can give more details over WhatsApp. She goes by evon (90423961) but her bank detail name was tan Qian Ying (9192 4281). Diff hp number quite bizarre to me. Ask to 'grab' orders then can get 30% commission off Evon acct to use as 'capital' for my accnt. Must grab 45 orders on my acct too then can withdraw everything. Eventually u hit an order where u need to top up your own money to complete it. Supposed to get everything back after u fulfil the order. The more money u start with the more u end up needing to top up bc you'll get larger orders. I played along while suspicious of it day 1 only needed to top up $50 total got back everything + commission. Day 2 hit an order to top up $600 did not do so. Tried to bypass the system by earning more 30% commission but was told by Evon the negative balance will not be cancelled off by new incoming commission. They add you into a chat grp where everyone shares their withdrawal/profit to gain your trust early on then put you in a position where u have to top up more and more. Eventually you'll fail to withdraw and lose everything. Had a friend who lost 10k to smth similar which is why I was on high alert from the start. Thankfully, didn’t lose any money hope everyone is more aware and alert so they don't fall for such scams.Editor's Note: If you received such messages, report and block the contact. DO NOT respond and DO NOT 'play along'. The money that you receive in the first few payouts could be illegal proceeds from other victims."

She told me that there was an issue with the internet address I had- my ip address was supposed to be 'private', but it was 'public' and that my internet would be cut because they were trying to fix this issue. She instructed me to type 'my ip' into a search bar on my laptop to prove she was correct. Thereafter she proceeded to ask me other details like modem information, how many lights were on on my modem, or which was the main device I used in the house which seemed suspicious . I asked her to verify first whether she was from Singtel and how I could, she quoted me this number ' 8004922408' to call, but I didn't think the number resembled a Singapore line or any recognisable number, so I left her on the phone, checked the Singtel hotline and called them to verify if this lady was working for them. they confirmed this was a scam. I put the phone down immediately. I hope more people hear about this so they too won't give out valuable information about their network settings."

Father is like a nomad, always moving around countries to countries. First to the UK, then to the us and settled down there. He will share with you sob stories of how his parents died in a car accident few years back, his fiancee broke up with him just before their wedding because she found out she is at the final stage of some cancer, does not have any family members around because their relationship was not good. Only have 1 best friend who is currently serving the army in Afghan. He is an oil rig consultant. Works offshore, and operates independently. Got himself a place here in Singapore. Told me that he has to travel to Houston for a submit conference, even screenshot to show you the content of his last minute invitation. Told me he has an oil rig contract to fulfil in Ukraine in 2 weeks’ time.Things started escalating quickly, he will just suddenly and randomly drop you a random WhatsApp call, and try to guilt trip you that you are avoiding him. And shortly after chatting, they will say they love you and ask you to be his partner. Even if they haven't seen you. Their reasoning is, they know that you are the one for them.i requested for a video call. But he gave quite a number of ridiculous reasoning like he can't do video calls because of where he is. But promise to call me on a certain day when he goes back to Baltimore.Scammer will try to sweet talk you and make you believe in him. Once he got to Ukraine for his contract, 2 weeks later, he will call or send you a text that his mud pump is faulty and he needed financial help. I was sceptical at first, but the way they speak to you, is so believable that you will think is true. And he sounded really desperate that all i wanted was to help, which I eventually did. And reasons for him asking for more money became more ridiculous, like paying his supplier and his workers, or having no money to eat, and needing to take a private jet back to the USA, so he can pay everyone that he has asked to borrow money from. When i suggested to him to take a commercial flight, another stupid reason came out again, and he will guilt trip you by saying you don't understand what he is going through. This was the time when i started to suspect that i got scammed, and made a police report."

I’ve been told my passport has been “black marked” which means I have to deport Singapore immediately and will no longer be eligible to work in Singapore in my entire life!! A High Court case was raised in Delhi too. I was doomed. I can get out of this if my dob can be re-verified and the case can be closed. But, have to report in Delhi high court by tomorrow to get the verification done and settle the case! He provided me with complete details of whomI should contact in Delhi and about the incident with reference numbers. So, I will have to leave tomorrow morning!He also informed if the verification in Delhi is successful, I have to meet an embassy officer in MOM, to verify my dob certificate, passport, employment pass again here in Singapore. The officer will provide me with the scan copy of immigration card that I had wrongly written, I have to fill in the correct details in the new immigration card. He will sign and email Singapore embassy in India to re-verify and close the case. Verification, case closing charges have to be borne by myself. I was given the option to do the process in Singapore itself by emailing scan copies of birth certificate, passports etc. to the Singapore embassy in Delhi. Then, I can visit MOM later today to meet the officer and finish the formalities to continue my stay.I was totally in it until he said the amount to pay was $900 for verification & $980 more for case closing! Gosh! Little suspicious now, I inquired if he is legal, he made me open mom.gov.sg website (the official, real mom website Singapore) and check ‘contact us’ page. The call on which I am is from the same phone number!! It must be true! Crazy! While he was trying to find closest sing post address so that I can make payment, I for some reason (was smart enough?) To google “MOM scam” and found that MOM website posted an alert warning users of such scams. I immediately disconnected the call."

I was away during Lunar New Year. My mother was very sick in Australia. I'm trying to buy a house in Singapore for my sick mother. I don't know how you could be of a help. I need to know types of houses available, keep in touch. Regards' I asked & he replied he is currently in Sydney and wish to buy a house in SG within budget of S$3mil to S$4mil.  On 22-02-2020, gave his Aust mobile no. +61421816242 & requested that we communicate via that. He shared his mom's poor health condition & asked me to pray for her recovery. He asked about my job (realtor), hobbies/interests, etc. He sent me pics of him with 2 grown-up sons & ex-wife, nice pics of his home's garden, charming pics of himself. His 2 sons & ex-wife in US. His age is 63+ & works as consultant. He said I'm his soulmate whom he enjoys chatting with. I'm always on his mind. He flew & arrived in Florida (Jacksonville) on 02-03-2020 to settle some contracts with the govt office.  He said he will fly to Singapore to meet me after he settled the important matters in Florida.On another day, he told me that his worker -  Johnson Lee - will be in SG on 15-03-2020 to assist him in purchase of  lubricant, jet oil, etc from ExxonMobil.   On 16-03-2020, Jackson whatsapp from mobile no. +65 91574284 that he arrived in SG and had busy day on appointments with Exxon and Shell companies for purchases of Aero jet fluid, petrochemical oil, crude oil, etc. David then sent me Purchase Order with pics of various types of oil  (see attachments) & asked my help for S$14,500, as he is short of funds.   I told him I don't have money to help him.  He was upset & called me heartless.  He then reduced amount from S$14,500 to S$6,000 then to S$5,000 but I maintained that I do not have financial means to help him.   He then turned angry & blocked me from his WhatsApp.  I am certain that Johnson is David's accomplice.  I found Johnson's pics on facebook with name David Wong.While reading stories posted in ScamAlert website, I saw a story posted on 26 Nov 2019 that scammer Mok (56 years old) whose photo looks like same person as this scammer David Wong.  I also found David Wong’s profile pics on Facebook but information given (such as From Hongkong, Lives in Singapore) are different from this scammer who told me that he's an Australian since birth.Please be wary of strangers who get in touch with you online."

I searched up qlik, it is a legit company that the scammers are impersonating, because it is relatively unheard of to the general public.On the website there is a real address but when i googled that address it belonged to another company, not theirs.Anyway how this scam works is that the person will try to earn your trust by topping up money into your account then 'training' you so that you can kinda take out some money at first, after which you have to top up your own money to complete boost missions.I did not top up of course, and just ignored all other messages from the scammer."

I thought the second day I would also earn about this amount.But I didn't expect the amount to get bigger and bigger and I end up depositing about 2100 sad to teo yan yan (phone no:89141718) account: 7693792??? (uob bank) on the second day (28/12/2021).I contacted my agent (linda) as I’m not able to deposit anymore and what she recommend me is to complete the data. Even if I approach customer service the system is still asking me to finish the order by deposit 2400 (within 8h) so that I can take all the money back, or else my account will be frozen for 180 days before I can take back my deposit (this is what the customer service say). After cooling down and telling my parent, I think I’m being scammed and decided to stop. If this system is real, I should be able to get back my deposit amount after 180 days.(well its alr passed 8 hours form 28/12/2021 2.47 pm until now 29/12/2021 3.39 am my order haven't been frozen lol)(well, I cant access the webpage anymore on 30/12/2021)Please be aware if you are in this situation, they might add u into a grp chat and there will be people sharing that they are able to deposit the money back which in turn, makes you think that maybe you can take your money back. Even if you approach them, they would tell you that they did this for weeks alr and they are getting the money back.After thinking through, i have make a police report and contact the bank.

One day, he claimed he went shopping, he wanted to send the items to me before he comes over, he says he do not have enough space in his luggage and the items he bought are expensive, not safe to keep in the hotel.  I asked for photos of the items, he sent some photos of jewellery and some other items, I told him those items are not what I liked and told him to return.

I said yes and he proceeded to ask me to pay for $500 as a 'loan insurance' for personal accidents,death etc etc. He even mentioned 'if any of above situation, this insurance will cover 100% of your payment thru out your loan period' . Since it was my first time taking loan, I agreed . proceeded to pay $500 for this 4K loan sum. Awhile later he told me he accidentally extended my loan to 8K and I am required to pay another $500. So thinking i could get 8K, i borrowed money from my friend and I transferred money over. So I transferred 1000 on the same day. The next morning, he texted me that he needed another 500 as he said that I transferred to the wrong acc. I needed to transfer another 500. So i borrowed another 500 from my friend and transferred to him to another acc. How I discovered that this was a scam because they asked me for another $500 as this one a one time policy thing since previously I transferred wrong and stuff like that. They said If I transferred another $500, they will stop asking and give me back my full 8000+1500 i have transferred. When asked if this was a scam, he said he wouldn't scam and said that if he want to scam he would have scam at least 5000 why bother with 500...."

He will always portray himself to be very reliable and nice. He proclaimed his love for me and affectionately although we have never met. He called me once and there was a strong accent that wasn’t American. When I requested for his pictures, he made many excuses not to send When he finally did, it was obviously not his own pics. After 2 weeks, he asked me to go into a business with him. It carried on until a month later when he claimed that he bought me many things and would be sending the items to me in Singapore. I rejected the idea at first but after his persistent requests, I relented. He didn’t tell me about the fees involved until I questioned him. He then became very frustrated and accused me of stressing him out. He told me not to worry as the courier company he went to was very reliable and he had used it before. However, the company doesn’t even exist. When I found out the proper procedures, I end off the relationship with him. The courier company he claimed to use is “Demont Courier Service”."

Very professional fluent English speaking callers, identifying himself/herself 'as SingTel technical department. Good afternoon. How are you today? Greetings. We detected high usage, hacking risk etc etc. Can you see if your router is blinking light etc. ' 3. Once I turn on my recorder and asked the caller to repeat, they will hang up immediately! 4.

She introduced herself as calling from Singtel and wanted to talk to me about my internet connection issues. I have been working from home for a while now, and my home internet is from another Telco company and is not under my name. My office is using Singtel, but nobody is there using the internet and I am not the person listed as a contact for internet issues. Therefore I thought her calling me was weird. I told her that I don't use Singtel, and she said 'Yeah I know, but let me tell you about Singtel. Singtel is the mother internet provider for whole of Singapore...' before she could finish I just cut off the call. It was so obviously a scam and a waste of time. Beware, people!!I checked the number and based on the country code, the call is from Kazakhstan. I don't think Singtel has a base there and would direct my internet connection issues to an overseas call centre. They probably didn't think I'd see the number because she called a land-line. So be careful if you can't see the caller ID! Ask questions to verify before providing any information! besides, she doesn't even know my name!"

Furthermore, this is the second time I received scam call from 'Singtel'.Please beware of this scam. Editor’s Note: Scammers are using spoofing technology to create fake numbers and numbers shown on users’ Caller ID are mostly fake, defunct numbers or belong to some innocent parties who didn’t make these calls. The best and most effective measure is to be able to recognise the red flags of a scam call and not fall prey to it.

This love scammer is so professionally manipulative.Scammer bio: match on tinder, korean born in france, work in HK, has thick French accent 34yo, contractor engineering, raised in orphanage since 4yo.Based on my experiences, i summarize his characteristics: 1. In the beginning, he will say hello on tinder and after several chats, asked to move to chat platform in my case is Whatsapp.2. After a few days, he will confess his feelings to you and wants to have a future with you and meet your parents (to convince you how serious he is)3. He will chat and call you every day, and keep saying will meet you in person soon and will buy you a flight ticket to visit him.4. He is willing to invest his energy and time in you and being so patience until he wins your trust and heart. Don’t be surprised if he is willing to do this for a long time, my case was 1 month, some were more than 6 months.5. He said want to settle down and buy a house in Singapore and asked me to find out how much the house price (wow…so convincing right?)6. Once he knew you fall for him and gain your trust. He will suddenly tell you that something bad happened to him.After 3 weeks of chatting, he told me he will travel overseas to win a contract and showed his picture on a flight. He told me he needs to pay for the unexpected contract registration for about usd15,000 and he was out of cash. He said he cannot use his france card because it is not activated for overseas use and needs 4 working days, so he was asking me shyly to lend him usd2000 to survive for 4 days. He asked to transfer to his driver’s bank account or his bitcoin. At first, i rejected and he said it’s alright, it’s not your fault and comforted me which is his technique to make you feel guilty and worried about him even more as it is real. He even said i still love you no matter what, saying good night as usual. The next day, i felt bad as “his woman” so i almost transferred to his bitcoin but thank god i went through this website before going to the atm.Overall, there are obvious signs from love scammer: 1. He will never do a video call with you even after you ask several times.2. He will never show you any of his social media (even he does then you need to check with google image or bing)3. He will never meet you in person even he has been texting and calling you regardless how long.4. In any circumstances, do not ever transfer any money/ invest to a person you have never met in person period!"

Wife passed on during childbirth.Switched to chat on LINE app on the same day we chatted on Paktor. Voice call on that same day via LINE to chat. Speaks English and no trace of Chinese nor Korean accent at all in his speech, more like a Caucasian accent. His occupation is a Construction Engineer in the Telecommunications industry.Started addressing me 'Sugar', 'Honey', 'Baby', 'Dear' Very reluctant to do video call (red flag).Texted every day without fail almost at the same timing, every morning and night. One month into the chat, said we were together for a month now. Days later, said he was bidding for a contract and will need to fly out to Germany for 3 weeks to complete the project. Got the project in just 2 days, competing with 3 other individuals and got it due to his past good works with the client. At this juncture, I had discovered that he’s using fake profile pics and the pics he sent were all extracted from IG. The real person behind those pics is a successful good looking Korean man residing in Korea. Flew to Germany on 04 Nov 2020. Followed the timing in Germany to send his texts promptly. Stayed in a hotel in Germany and no lockdown in Germany. There’s no truth in his words.1 week in Germany was I was asked to transfer monies of EURO 1500 to him as his card was blocked and insufficient cash on hand to buy a material in Germany. No monies was lost at my end.Ladies, be extra cautious when you come across scammers through dating apps. Do a Google image reverse search and pay attention to the details on their given pics to pick up clues to search for more information on the web regarding that person.Bank Details to transfer the monies:Name: theophilus Marfo Bank name: Sparkasse bankDestination of bank transfer: Germany"

He asked me if i prefer lunch or dinner etc.6) next day he called me when i was sleeping but then i just somehow felt something was amiss, because this friend of mine has my instagram, why didnt he message me on insta.7)  i whatsapped his original number and he told me it wasnt him( so luckily, i lost nothing)( probably will call me to borrow number etc)So, if anyone has a friend who calls you out of the blue, please call the old number to check if it is indeed your friend whom you are speaking to!"

The lady said my router is having errors and asked me to check the status of the lights. I told her they were solid no blinking. Then she said she'll escalate the call to her senior engineer. So senior engineer then told me that my internet was being misused by people from remote parts of the world and wanted to check my router. He commanded me to turn on the computer to which i said i don't have one. Then he passed the call back to the lady and who asked me why i lied to her 'senior'. I continued to play dumb and explained that i had several devices connected to my wifi but none of them were a pc. Then she asked if she can get me a computer to which i said i only use a smart tv to work. I asked her to send a personnel to my house address to check out the issue to which she accepted and hung up the call.Editor's Note: Please do not engage with scammer and our advice is to end the call the moment you realised that call is a scam."

As my intention was to get to know how to commjnicate with ladies better, i decided to message her. In our conversation she didnt mentioned anything about the amount needed to pay to meet up with her. So on 18 March 2020, the date we decided to meet, she asked me to give her my contact number for her 'friend' to give me a call regarding their procedure of meeting up. And there were a few calls made by 2 different persons without any caller ID. Through our conversation, they have requested for me to transfer first $100 followed by $600 and $1000 done via alipay on the axs machine. When they asked me transfer the $1000 i was feeling abit suspicious about the conversation and decided to transfer $300 claiming that I do not have sufficient amount to transfer the full $1000. And in our last call, after I raised the concern about not being able to transfer the remaining $700 and requested for the refund of a total of $1000, he began to threatened me saying that If I were to pull anymore tricks, they would come and haunt me and my family.Note to all other individuals who are going to experience this scam:1. Check if any payment is needed to be paid upfront before meeting up. If yes, dont bother meeting up with the other person. But if you still insist on wanting to meet up check the amount to be paid first 2. When you are asked to give your phone number for her 'friend' to call you, do not ever give your phone number3. Once it reached the threatening phase, request for the longest possible timing to look for funding and take this opportunity to go and make a police report."

They verified my address and was able to mention the 2 credit cards that were linked to the Amazon account last 4 digits of my credit card. The lady went on to pass on to her manager as she claims he has to verify some details with me in order to stop all the transactions from the hacker. He asked me for my full credit card details of the 2 cards mentioned in the Amazon including the expiry date and the pin at the back. I initially find it weird, why would they require such details to such extent. He convinced me he needed it to activate the OTP sent via SMS from the bank and I just have to read it. This way they need me to approve the transaction which he is making so he can stop the payment and reverse it back to my credit card. I am clueless in this and he convinced me. Then he went on to ask me how many other credit cards I possess as the hacker might also hack into my other cards under my name and made other transactions with Amazon. At first, I was thinking how would the hacker able to find my other credit cards under my name and I believed him and proceed to give all my other credit card details to him including the OTP messages pin that comes in. It was until the last few credit cards that I name which is OCBC, UOB and CItibank. While I was still on the line with Amazon which was an hour now, OCBC called me regarding the transaction just made and I explained to them, realising that I could be scammed after informed by OCBC. They tried to call me another 4 times while I was still on the call with OCBC, each time was of a different number. I called all the banks to immediately block my card and stop all transactions and they will issue a new card for me. I went into Standard Chartered to file a transaction dispute then realise of the many transactions I have approved unknowingly which amount to at least few thousand KRW. UOB transaction was SGD2000+.and was always to the few same companies. I am glad OCBC managed to contact me and made me realise I was scammed, otherwise my money might have been taken."

Then when he was overseas, he needed to buy some equipment. and actually shared his on-line banking details, so that i could help him purchase his equipment. then the internet bank has a limit on the amount transferred, and that's when he asked for an infusion of funds, into his personal account, to help him pay for this purchase. so i could see that he had a few million dollars in his account.This scam is so elaborate as ELLSCORPS CAPITAL/ALTEC EQUIPMENTS/INTEGRITY ENERGY SOLUTIONS all have legitimate websites, so upon first checking, they appear to be legit. however, upon doing a second layer of checks, i drew a blank. eg: ellscrops capital claimed to be a subsidiary of citicorp USA, but checks drew nothing. the companies mentioned also have photos/addresses etc. Altec equipments also am based in the US, and their website shows proper addresses, contact numbers etc.PLEASE ALL BE CAREFUL!"

He said that I need to click on 80 submissions to get a $500 weekly pay. However, there will be times where I need to deposit my own money in order to proceed, otherwise i cannot withdraw any money. As I continued to use the website, the deposit seemed to get larger, to the point that I cannot pay up. Since I did not complete my orders, I have lost $10,000 to them.So, I wanted people to be wary about unsolicited jobs offers on social media platforms like WhatsApp and telegram, and any job offers that require you to 'submit data' in order to get commissions.

We exchanged some pleasantries and i asked whether i know her from somewhere, but somehow 'she' claimed that she is from Malacca and working at a yoga studio in Suntec city. And that she apparently has a part-time job that she does at night at home which was about tallying accounts, which i didn't think much of. After a while she asked if it's ok to move the conversation to WhatsApp and i agreed.We asked about each other and exchanged greetings, she claimed to stay with her older brother and her sister in law. After a few days, she even took photos of her surroundings to show her whipping up some dishes at home and watching ndp. She then asked if i am interested in helping her with her part time job. I agreed wondering what's so difficult about the part time job. Turns out, she gave me a number to 'Chanel' and told me to message them to say that i'm helping her.The message I got told me to take a screenshot of a 'Chanel' product, then to transfer $98 to their account. At first, I did receive back the $98+$15 commission then, I proceed to accept the 2nd order, this is where the real scam starts. The 2nd product cost $825. After I transferred to the account like the first order, the person told me to process and transfer another $3300. I asked him why and he said that this order has 5 products, and I only transferred 1/5 of the amount, and so I needed to transfer the balance amount for the remaining 4 items, left 4/5 haven't transfer. When I asked this girl to transfer me $3300 and she refused to. I told her my bank only left $500 so she ask me to transfer $500 to that account and she will help me with the remaining sum. And so I did as I was told and I screenshot and send transfer slip as proof but she didn't respond after that.  I am sharing this story to stop the next victim from falling into the scammer's trap."

I try to find the part time job from website and found the clickwork website. It have a whatapps to get you in touch with them.They tell me the job mission is call Affiliate marketing for Shopee to help new seller to push the sales for community. The tasks seems easy, follow the so called job assigned and add the designated goods to shopping cart, screenshot to them, transfer the money to the merchant provided by them and very soon they bank in back the money + commission in just a minutes and encourage you to do 5 tasks to get more rewards. The first 2 mission was done smoothly, funds was transfer back with commission in just a minutes. Until the 3rd mission the traps coming in, I have been in doubt, struggling and try to call those “participants” in the so call VIP group to verify whether it’s a scam. Look back the situation, seems the participants most properly is the team from the scam group.They show contacts in whatapps, they provide bank account. I was too good to believe if it is a scam they won’t show all these information. Now i find that even though report to police, I think it hard for the authority to charge them for scam as everything looks so normal and legal.The feeling of frustrated and angry just can’t help with it after my money not being refunded (it is my 3 months living costs). I have been thought I am a very caution and alert person, but seriously now i am thinking in deep and ask my god what happen and why it happen to me!I was sleepless the whole night, the feeling of pain and breathless from heart and body. The feeling of being cheated is so bad!No matter how, the following action still need after calm down:1. Report to police.2. Talk to family or friend. (family member please do not scold, the victim already feel so bad and the Scam group is so smart and professional)。3. I am still trying to deep introspect myself how could it happen to me.

And I thought it might be a good guy. Talking for about a week and he said he had this contract which he had been pursuing for a long time and was asked to go for an interview the next day. And asked to wish and pray FOR HIM and would give me a surprise if he got his contract. Next day, he said that he had been awarded for the contract and he was very happy and did shopping for himself and things he needed for the contract and also took the opportunity to shop for me and would send me before he went for his contract work for 2months offshore. He asked for my full name and address. I did give him my name but not in full and address. He then later send me the link of the COURIER and tracking id to CHECK. I go in the link and check the status. Only showed his name and number with no ADDRESS and with my name and address. He then sent me the pictures of the gifts AND i was shocked. He said that he bought a hp laptop, iPhone x, Samsung galaxy, Scottish hang bag, ladies gold wristlet watch, pieces of jewellery necklace and mention all the jewellery are GOLD. I rejected him and asked to cancel the shipment and he said it was his way of showing his appreciation to me. He did this because he cared and loved me so much. At first, I believed him but after cooling down and doing a bit of research, I found that this courier company is a fraud, and also found many similar cases of love scams. He then sent me a picture of bundles of cash. And said that I could take the money to HELP needy people and the rest is for me and my FAMILY and also mention to meet after his contract. After that, I cut off all contact and blocked him. COURIER: demont courierHTTP://WWW.DEMONTexport.com (fake courier company)"

He showed me himself on video call, which was right. Same person as on the page. About a week later he told me about investment, since I seen him I started to trust him. He got from me around 2200 eur and told if I want to withdraw I have to pay an interest fee of 25% of the withdrawal amount. He told me too late I HAVE to. Refused to pay until we meet face to face, which somehow I knew will never happen. He disappeared, I found him from douyin."

Mentioned about some upcoming events in SG (11 Jun 2022). Did not go for the event.Next call received was on 29 Jun 2022. Mentioned that even though I did not attend the event, but because I picked up the first call, I became eligible for their lucky draw. And I won the third prize in their lucky draw, worth HKD 590,000, which is more than SGD 100,000. I mentioned I wasn't interested at first, but caller, who sounds like a Taiwanese lady, was persistent in asking if I really wanted to give up SGD 100,000+. I figured I'll just see what info they'll ask for.After 1 hour of some background info about the company, and some random chatter, I gave some personal info to her, including full name (English and Chinese), mobile number, date of birth, and my NRIC number. She mentioned she needed to submit the application form, so will get back to me the next day.The next day, she mentioned the application was successful, and asked for my bank account number to transfer the money to. I gave it to them, as I didn't perceive a risk. At this point, I was more convinced it was real, but still retained a bit of skepticism.The next day, she called to chit chat for about 20 minutes (I think they are trying to put a personality to your identity through these exchanges), before telling me she can only give me an update the next week as they don't work on the weekends. No other information retrieved from me.Over the weekend, I tried to search if there are scams that are similar to this, and found them here on scamalert.sg. After comparing too many similarities, I realised I was being scammed.The next time the lady called (Mon), I listened to her for about 5 minutes, and just ended the call without saying anything. She has not called back since."

After a few hrs, ricky called me thru whatsapp to inform me that the loan has been approved. He then told me that his company will transfer me a sum of $300 and after a wk i had to return $500, this is to test whether i have the ability to pay back the loan on time a.k.a trial loan. I returned the $500 5 days (on 12 ma), to a posb sav acc stated in the details, however, Ricky told me that i had made a wrong transfer as i did not indicate “ricky clear” as the reference name, he then requested me to transfer another $500 to the same bank acc, and he also told me that the $500 i had paid extra would be credited back to me tgt with the 20k loan after i sign the agreement. I did as he told me and transferred a sum of $500 to him, thereafter, he explained to me that there is an admin fee that i had to pay before i could get the loan, this admin fee is 10% of the loan amt, which is $2000, however, i explained to him that i didnt had enough money and could only fork out $1100, he said he would help me think of ways to help me temporarily pay the remaining $900 of admin fee, after that he msg me and told me that he managed to lend $900 from his wife, and wanted me to pay the $1100 from my acc, while he pay $900 for me, he told me not to tell anyone as helping clients to pay funds is illegal, and also told me to return him immediately after i get the loan. The next day, he told me that his manager found out about the funds and questioned him, and also confiscated the funds until i could fork out the remaining $900. I took around 5 days to raise the $900 and transferred him, he also promised me that there would not be anymore issues. However, the next day, he messaged me again to say that the funds could not be drawn out as it is under a red column. Knowin that something was wrong, I called the police after that.Editor's Note: Please note that licensed moneylenders are not allowed to advertise their services online, via messaging apps or SMS.

When she asked the third time today, i finally accepted. Being careful i've asked if she stays alone, if she has family here to make sure no one is behind her (syndicate). She agree to meet me up at admiralty MRT.She was nowhere to be seen but wants my mobile number to be secure. She asked me to meet a friend to ensure she's not being fished by a police. Immediately, I fled as I didn’t want someone else to know. She begged me to stay and proceed while I kept receiving calls from unknown number. I answered the call with the china manager explained the procedures and protocol as she was student part time escort under a hotel.To protect the both parties, payment will be alipay top up from AXS. I purposely left my atm card at home, so he asked for itunes credit ($100) from 711. He emphasised not to drop the call as he will guide me. He then required my ID to ensure I’m not a police but I didn’t have any id with me. He claimed he is one of the 鸿门 member and they are running casino369.com. They have some system that can identify an enforcer. He asked to get my id from my place 15 mins’ away and arranged her to meet me up at the hotel nearby. I went back and sent my license to him. He quickly asked if I am a cop as there is no employment history for my identity except for basic information. He said I could  make a deposit to secure the meet up. He'll arrange at a nearby AXS  The deposit would be refunded via cash once we meet. He requested for rmb 1000 x 3 (declined as lack of $$) but reduced to rmb 500 ( i bought alipay $104).He got angry for fooling him as he asked for rmb1000 alipay. I told him I couldn’t afford and willing to forfeit. He insisted that deposit must be paid. He threatened to hunt down my family, use my name for money laundering since he has my licence. He give me till 9pm and reminded me that don't go missing or ignoring his calls. However she had instructed me to gather $1200 as her manager has told her to do. She then continued to beg me as she will be in trouble. Now i'm receiving death threats after stop replying her and answering calls."

She told me i needed to mail the bag out to her immediately so that she could get it the next day as she would be overseas after. She asked for my postal code to help arrange a courier service for me. She then asked for my bank account number to transfer me the money for the bag and the courier service. I gave the bank number but told her not to send me the money until i confirmed the shipping. She then sent me screenshots of an apparent wire transfer from bank of America. At this point, I had called courier companies and many told me that it was impossible for the bag to arrive on the stipulated time. So, I told her that I would refund her the money and that we should stop the transaction altogether. I checked my bank and no money was received and in the screenshot she sent it said the wire transfer was 'non-refundable', which was strange. She then proceeded to spout vulgarities at me and threatened to ruin my life and that I would 'be dead in 24 hours'. Her story didn’t check out as wire transfers also usually cannot happen over the weekends and she sent me a screenshot of her account balance to 'prove' that she had paid. I told her she could call the bank since the wire transfer did not go through, and to cancel it, but she still didn't give up.I went to the Police to report the matter as her behaviour was highly suspicious and I was feeling afraid that I could be targeted."

I asked her how come she is the one telling me and not the Chanel person. She just said to trust her which made me not trust her. I challenged her to transfer me $100 and i will use that $100 to transfer to that account and if i get $115 back I will give her back the $100. She then started insulting me saying this is why I will stay poor and i told her i'd rather work part time jobs that exchange time for money than participate in her money laundering scam.My story is exceedingly similar to this other one i found on the website https://www.scamalert.sg/stories-details/story-06aug2022235435pm"

Few days later, I was a bit suspicious so i went down to make a police report. And i was informed that there was already a report against me for that bank account which was used hence it was frozen.I am stressed beyond believe. Now, I'm just waiting for the officer to call me down to take my statement. I Feel so helpless and I honestly Thought that it was a real part time job. My entire family has never had a criminal record once and its stressing me so much to think that i could be sentenced.One things for sure, I will never use Carousell to search for jobs. Carousell needs to have a better system for jobs listing, despite my efforts to report the user, it wasn’t taken down as the user did not violate any terms so there are more people who are looking at the same exact job posting that I saw and applied and Could potentially fall for this."

I stopped her and told her it was a scam. When i called the number back, 69664756, it was an indian national (from the accent) who picked up the phone. I suspect the scammer might have used his phone number to call my mum.Kindly let MOH know on this scam too, thank you!"

Thereafter he got me to register for my own and began asking me to deposit more cash so that i can get more returns. I started with $200 and i eventually deposited $5k as i grew more confident.At this point, he got me to participate in an event by the app, whereby if i deposited $30k in 3 days, i would receive an additional $1688. He informed me that he participated in the event as well.However, the next day i was informed by the app's help desk that if i do not deposit 30k, i would not be able to withdraw from my account which had 6k at that point in time.Thus, i quickly deposited 15k and en 'helped' me with 15k.Thereafter i was told to make an investment before i can withdraw my money. While making that investment, i was informed that my account is frozen because i had violated the app's regulations. In order to unfreeze the account, i would have to deposit another 15k.Feeling very stressed and confused, i called my friend to borrow money and told him about what had happened.Only then i realized i had been scammed.The numbers used by en:+65 84468801+65 88594534+65 93490991he used the last 2 numbers to whatsapp me after i've blocked him.凯基 KGI helpdesk number:+852 95592024"

He topped up $2k to his account 2x bec it’s a bonus task and we need to recharge the acct to earn. Top up amt can be withdrawn. At the end of the 38 tasks, he earned $453 in commission and I could take a 24% cut. To withdraw, I needed to complete 38 tasks in my own acct and top up money in the process. Please beware. I knew it was too good to be true coz everything abt it was so stupid and senseless so i decided to waste his time. Blocked him on WhatsApp."

Very fast to profess interest.  Claims to work in Singapore in the finance industry.  claims to be earning very well and his investments are very successful that made him a rich man. Most of these people will try to get us to move to WhatsAPP or Line or Messenger.  I did not agree to whatsapp but as I don't have much personal information on facebook Messenger, I agree to it.  Facebook tries to protect people by allowing the person to see only posts that are Public if the requests is from the dating APP.  All went well though there were subtle warning signs in what he shared about himself that is quite hard to believe or some contradicting information.  What exposed him is that someone else (probably His partner and is part of a SYNDICATE) created a profile with photos of the same person, different name and details, and tried to befriend me too.  When I ask for a VIDEO call to see if he will agree to it, He responded that he prefers to see me in person and asked for my address and that he will drive over immediately to pick me up.  It is late in the night.  And then he insisted that he wants to bring me to his condo to have a look.  I refused his suggestion and told him that I know that he does not want to video call and then block him. I did not give him ADDRESS or meet him.   when I contact him to do the video call, he told me that he was busy.  That his older sister called him and is giving him information to open an account for him to trade digital currencies.  He told me that it will only take about 10+ mins to do it and can earn money.  He took the opportunity to ask me if I want to do it too.  I declined and asked him how come he has an older sister when he had earlier shared that he has an older brother only.  His response is that it is his cousin.  Having stumbled on this website and read other people's stories, I think this 'Sister' must be his latest victim.  Please be careful."
