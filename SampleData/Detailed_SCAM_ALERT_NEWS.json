            "Description": "SINGAPORE: Small business owner Dayana Rizal, 27, is no stranger to dealing with online buyers, but the one she encountered on Oct 3 seemed particularly - in her words - 'harmless'.Ms Dayana, who sold clay mugs on her now-defunct Instagram page potekceramics, said the buyer was a sweet talker who seemed clueless about how to purchase her mugs online.The buyer, using a private Instagram account with a few hundred followers, sent Ms Dayana a direct message with a screenshot of her wares, saying: 'I want to buy this.''There were multiple items inside (the screenshot), so in my head I was thinking like, there are so many (products) inside - which one do you want to buy?' Ms Dayana told CNA, recalling her exchange with the buyer during some lull time at work.'So I just assumed it was like a clueless makcik or aunty who was blur and didn't know how to order through Instagram. I think I let my guard down also because the person behind the account was calling me 'dear' and all that.' Ms Dayana, who works in a pottery studio and conducts workshops, then referred the buyer to her website, asking them to check what was available and complete the purchase there. But the buyer insisted on buying through Instagram.'I guess she really doesn't know how to use the computer,' Ms Dayana remembered thinking then, laughing at her own naivete. 'I sound so stupid now that I'm recounting it.'I was honestly trying to close the sale because it's always exciting when someone wants to buy your stuff,' she added. 'But also I wanted to help her; not everyone knows how to use a website.'Ms Dayana relented, telling the buyer they could send the money to her mobile number. The buyer then asked how much it would cost to deliver to Yishun, so Ms Dayana replied that it was a S$5 delivery fee islandwide.The buyer's next question, however, led to the first red flag.The buyer asked if she was the owner or admin of the potekceramics Instagram page, ostensibly to verify that they were dealing with the business owner. Ms Dayana confirmed that she owned the business.'She was like, okay, just to make sure, I'll send in a request to Instagram to send you a message just to check whether you're the real owner or not. Once you receive the message, can you send me a screenshot? Then I'll make the PayNow to your number,' she said.What Ms Dayana did not realise was that the buyer was actually using Instagram's password reset function to take over her account.Ms Dayana then got a text message from Facebook with a link to reset her Instagram password. Without 'thinking' or scrutinising the message, she took a screenshot of it and forwarded it to the buyer.'I didn't look at it carefully. I thought it was just like a message from Facebook to verify that I'm the real owner,' she said, admitting that the official nature of the message threw her off, and that it was so quick and easy to take a screenshot of a message and pass it on.'I was really clouded by, one, I wanted to close the sale. Secondly, I just thought she was a harmless aunty. I thought she didn't want to be scammed, and I understood also because I didn't want to be scammed.'But in the end, I also got scammed.'SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS TARGETEDOther small business owners have encountered buyers who try to use this seemingly simple method of taking over an Instagram account.On Sep 21, the owner of handmade jewellery business Ellaie took to TikTok to recount how she was almost deceived by the same ruse, saying in a video that the buyer who tried it was very 'unassuming'.A Straits Times report on Oct 2 also detailed how a man who sold kueh lapis on Instagram fell victim to the method, losing access to his account and a large number of his 5,000 followers, some of them loyal customers. After Ms Dayana sent the buyer the screenshot of the message, they said thanks and she did not think much about it. But less than an hour later, when she opened her Instagram app, a pop-up said she had been logged out.Ms Dayana went back to that official message Facebook had sent, and realised that it was a link to reset her password. She tried the link but it did not work.She then tried using her username and phone number to sign in to her page, but the app said the username and number did not exist. She realised that she had lost all access to her Instagram page.Ms Dayana was panicking at this point, especially as the person who took over her page had blocked her personal account from viewing it too. She tried using Instagram's account recovery function, which asked her to send a video selfie to confirm her identity. Instagram emailed her on the same day saying it could not identify her, asking her to submit another video. She has not done so and has not received any word from Instagram since.Ms Dayana said she got frustrated.'I shouldn't have to put in so much effort to try and get back my account. I kind of want Instagram to take down the account,' she said, adding that she plans to reach out to Instagram and browse Reddit for tips.A quick check by CNA on Oct 13 confirmed that the potekceramics page - now with a slightly modified page name - remains online, although the scam posts have been deleted. Meta, Instagram's parent company, did not respond to requests for comment.SCAM POSTSMs Dayana's friends sent her updates about her page, saying that the new owner was posting investment-related scams and sending direct messages to her followers about it.Some of the scam posts were plastered on a picture of Ms Dayana and her boyfriend, which she believes was downloaded off her highlights reel. She found this 'creepy'.Ms Dayana's friends reported the account to Instagram and blocked it in hopes of flagging it as being hacked. Some of them also messaged the new owner, telling them to give it up.The new owner was brazen in their response, Ms Dayana said, adding that they 'liked' the angry messages and told her friends to stop wasting their time.'It just felt like a bit more targeted and quite personal,' she said. 'Not like a random robot that's trying to scam you.' One friend said that one creator she follows had also been approached with the same tactics by the same buyer on the same day that Ms Dayana was fooled.Ms Dayana said she was not worried about losing customers, highlighting that her pottery friends with large followings had posted about the incident and pointed her followers to her new Instagram page, potekceramic.Her old page, started in early 2021, had about 600 followers.'I didn't want my brand to be associated with this kind of scam, so that's why I didn't really bother trying to recover that account. Because to me, it's already tainted. So, I already created a new account just to start afresh,' she said.'I'm not that worried about losing followers because I know that those who really care about my brand and the work that I make will find me one way or another.''JUST BE A BIT MORE PRESENT'Ms Dayana said she is considering making a police report but acknowledged that she has got over the frustration of losing her account. She said she is telling her story so others do not fall for the same trap.'You know, life is more than just Instagram, so I've been busy like actually working,' she said.Ms Dayana said the incident has left her wary of doing business through direct messages on Instagram, adding that she recently removed a 'weird' follower and blocked them out of caution.She advised small business owners who deal over Instagram to really look into a buyer's account and be vigilant of what they are asking for.'Don't get so into the moment when you want to make a sale. Just be a bit more present,' she said, adding that she felt 'greedy' at the point of getting tricked.'Even if the message is from Facebook, I think other people should read carefully about what the message is telling them to do.'"

            "Description": "SINGAPORE - Online shoppers who come across deals from third-party resellers for popular electronic devices such as the iPhone 14 should be wary of scams, said the police.In the first week of October alone, at least 118 people have fallen victim to scams involving sales of iPhone, with total losses amounting to at least $389,000.The police on Tuesday advised members of the public to remain vigilant, as scammers ask online buyers to make advance payments for newly released electronic devices with no intention of delivering them.The police added that people should follow crime prevention measures such as purchasing electronic products only from authorised sellers or reputable sources, using in-built payment options that release payments to sellers only upon delivery and avoid making advance payments or direct bank transfers to sellers.People should also be wary about scammers who offer better deals in exchange for payments being made directly to them, and to not fall for tactics where scammers show personal details in an attempt to prove that they are genuine sellers.Members of the public can visit the scam alert website or call the Anti-Scam Hotline on 1800-722-6688 for more information about scams.Anyone with information on scams can call the police hotline 1800-225-0000, or submit information online.",

            "Description": "SINGAPORE: The Singapore Police Force (SPF) on Sunday (Oct 2) warned of a new variant of SMS phishing scams where scammers would target victims with similar sender's ID to obtain their Singpass login credentials. In a news release, the police said they have seen a surge in cases where people would receive unsolicited SMSes with the sender's ID containing similarities to Singpass, such as MySingpass or SGSingpass. The SMSes would indicate that the recipients’ Singpass accounts had been or would be deactivated, and that they were required to conduct facial verification. They would then be required to log into Singpass through a web link provided in the messages. Upon clicking on the link, the victims would be directed to a spoofed Singpass login webpage, where they would be required to enter their Singpass ID and password.They would then be led to a two-factor authentication page asking for their Singpass one-time password, said the police. The victims would only realise they were scammed when they received alerts from Singpass that their profiles were updated. In some cases, the victims would receive alerts that they had signed up for bank accounts and credit cards. In some cases, unauthorised transactions were also charged to the credit cards.'While the authorities have taken down the phishing websites, user vigilance is crucial in our fight against evolving scams,' said the police. SINGPASS DOES NOT SEND SMSES CONTAINING WEB LINKS'The police and GovTech would like to advise members of the public to be on heightened alert,' said the authorities. Members of the public were advised that Singpass does not send SMSes containing web links asking recipients to log in with their credentials, such as passwords and one-time passwords. The official SMS' sender identity is labelled as Singpass or SingPass. Singpass users can verify the authenticity of the claims against their Singpass account via the Singpass hotline at 6335 3533 and press 9 for 24-hour scam support. They should also ensure that the Singpass website domain they are accessing is singpass.gov.sg, with a 'lock' icon in the address bar. Users were also advised to update their contact details registered with Singpass and enable notifications via their Singpass app so that they can be promptly alerted of suspicious logins, such as when a login on a new device or Internet browser is detected.'If you suspect that your Singpass account has been compromised, reset your Singpass password immediately,' said the police. Log-ins to Government services should only be done at websites with domains ending with '.gov.sg'. If a link received does not end with '.gov.sg', users should check it against the list of trusted websites at www.gov.sg/trusted-sites. The police also advised users to never disclose their personal or Internet banking details and one-time passwords to anyone and to report any fraudulent transactions to their bank immediately."

            "Description": "SINGAPORE - Android users can now download an app called ScamShield, which can block calls from blacklisted numbers that have been verified as scam-related.The app, which can also identify scam SMSes, is available on Google Play Store.It has been available to iOS users since November 2020.The Android version was officially launched on Wednesday by Senior Minister and Coordinating Minister for National Security Teo Chee Hean and Minister of State for Home Affairs and Social and Family Development Sun Xueling, during a dinner to commemorate the National Crime Prevention Council's (NCPC) 40th anniversary at Sands Expo and Convention Centre.The app, developed by NCPC and Open Government Products, a division of the Government Technology Agency (GovTech), blocks calls from a database that is managed by NCPC and the police. It was soft-launched on Sept 1. While the Android version has almost the same features as the iOS one - such as blocking and reporting scam messages and calls - the iOS version is able to divert scam messages to a junk folder, while the Android version only notifies users of them.This is due to specific limitations of the Android operating system, the police said on Wednesday.Scam SMSes detected by ScamShield are sent to NCPC and the police for collation, which the police said helps keep the app updated, to better protect users from scam calls and messages.The police said that as at Sept 14, the ScamShield's iOS version has been downloaded by more than 315,000 users and has resulted in more than 5.8 million SMSes being reported, and more than 29,000 phone numbers, believed to be used for scam calls, blocked.In January, NCPC chairman Gerald Singham responded to a forum letter in The Straits Times which asked about the progress of ScamShield for Android phones.Mr Singham said that while it had been earlier announced that the version would be available at the end of 2021, timelines were delayed as GovTech had to reprioritise resources towards supporting the Government's response to Covid-19.",

            "Description": "Follow us on Telegram for the latest updates: https://t.me/mothershipsg It began with a Telegram message.The text, from an unknown user going by the name Josephine Chang, promised a quick and easy job with reasonable commissions.Enticed by the opportunity, Lina (not her real name) replied to express her interest.The job seemed simple enough. Chang told Lina that she had to rate airlines via an online platform to 'promote and advertise' the airlines. The more ratings Lina completed, the more commission she would get.But with a catch: first, she had to make a deposit. Screenshot of a text message from Chang. Photo courtesy of Lina. Screenshot of the rating system. Photo courtesy of Lina.Snowball effect Lina, a 28-year-old admin manager, considers herself a trusting character. Even so, she shared that at the start, she 'really didn't want to do it'.But Chang was persuasive. She explained that the deposit was required to prove the authenticity of the ratings â after all, every rating has to be tied to a transaction. Screenshot of a text message from Chang. Image courtesy of Lina.The money would be returned to her, Chang assured, with the commission on top of it. All Lina had to do was take that first step.The first sum Lina was told to deposit was S$112. Lina said she has heard stories about scams making the rounds, but she did not think she was falling into one as a victim -- even when she had to fork out money.'[I thought] if lose it, then lose it,' she said. 'But I got some money (S$11) credited to me. So I was like 'ok sure, let's proceed'.'Unfortunately, things went downhill from there. After that first transaction, Chang informed her that to continue rating the airlines, she would have to top up some money into the online platform. This would be used to pay the merchants so the platform could continue offering this service, she explained. Lina complied.But as she continued to make increasingly large payments â each one to a different bank account â Lina began to face problems.When she attempted to withdraw her earnings, she received an error message informing her that she had to complete another rating first.And after she did so, she was told that she had to top up even more money before she could make a withdrawal. The platform, which calls itself Aeroclass.org. The real Aeroclass.org appears to be an aviation training website. Photo courtesy of Lina.By then, Lina no longer cared about earning commissions â she just wanted to get her initial 'investment' back. She said:'But eventually, I still cannot (sic) save myself.' Her sixth and final transaction was a deposit of S$20,104 on Sep. 20, the day after after she received that first message.In total, she lost S$34,226 in just two days. Screenshot of Chang's latest message to Lina, sent on Sep. 26. Photo courtesy of Lina.Still received messages When she realised she had fallen victim to a scam, she was 'very upset and desperate', she shared.This was especially since she'd borrowed money from her mother as capital for the so-called investment.As Chang continued to send her increasingly urgent messages, asking her to top up even more money â S$42,000 â to retrieve her deposit, she felt torn.'The urge to top up was there, but I really didn't have the money to continue,' she said.Instead, Lina decided to file a police report on Sep. 21. 'They told me the money is as [good as] gone,' she said.'And I don't think the bank will give me the money out of goodwill. So now it's just... I don't know.'Her family still does not know about the scam.The police confirmed that a report was lodged and investigations are ongoing.No red flags Lina shared that previously, she had done other legitimate surveys to earn money.The scam was also made more believable by the fact that she was added into a group chat with several other 'employees'. The participants would text in that chat daily, reporting how much they earned that day.'I don't know if they are victims like me or simply admins,' she admitted.For now, Lina hopes to use her income from her regular job to slowly pay her mother back. The first few days after the scam, she suffered from panic attacks â but she has been gradually coming to terms with the events.She also hopes her ordeal can help spread awareness among the public.'It is not just older aunties or uncles getting scammed, but it has also come to the younger generation,' she said.She added:'[These scammers] make people feel like just killing themselves... the sums are too huge.'

            "Description": "SINGAPORE - When a flustered man walked into UOB Bank's main branch trying to bank in a cheque of more than $150,000 to an offshore account, service associate Jenny Hong got suspicious.The first telltale sign was the name of the account holder and the account number did not match, she said.When Ms Hong, 46, probed the man, in his 70s, further and asked why he needed to send money to the overseas account, he grew more rattled.The incident happened earlier this year at the bank's main branch in Raffles Place.Ms Hong said: 'It was odd because he was trying to bank in such a large amount of money into an account that was not his. He kept saying it was very urgent and when I asked him more about it, his answers grew more and more incoherent.'Sensing something amiss, Ms Hong, who has worked at UOB for 27 years, flagged the incident to the bank's assistant branch manager Alison Cheng.They then realised the man was being scammed.Ms Cheng, 55, said: 'He said the money was for his girlfriend in The Netherlands.'He told me he had just met her on Facebook and knew her for two months. She insisted she needed his money to complete a business deal and get commission from it.'At that point, Ms Cheng's aim was to convince the man he was being scammed and persuade him to halt the transfer.'I asked if he had seen scam articles in the news. He said yes, but insisted he was not being scammed.'He said it was love and his girlfriend needed the money urgently,' recounted Ms Cheng.She spent the next half an hour convincing him about scams and it was only then did he understand he had almost become a victim of an Internet love scam.Ms Cheng added: 'The man was suddenly resolute and told us not to carry out the transaction.'He also made a police report. According to the mid-year crime statistics released by the police last month, more than $20 million was lost to Internet love scams in the first six months of the year.There were 477 cases in the first half of 2022, a dip from the 546 cases during the same period last year.Mr Richard Soh, group head of integrated fraud management at UOB, said staff at bank branches are trained to spot telltale signs of suspicious transactions and take appropriate actions to handle them.'These include dissuading customers from sanctioning questionable transactions and assisting them to report scams to the police,' he said.National University of Singapore business professor Lawrence Loh said it is assuring the preventive measures against scams are not just a part of an abstract policy, but have been internalised in financial institutions here.More of such interventions will sustain the confidence level of overseas investors in our financial hub, he noted.Prof Loh, whose expertise is on strategy and policy, added: 'Every scam case can add up to the small hit that scams as a whole may have on Singapore's reputation as a financial hub.'So, if we can eradicate whatever impact scams have on our reputation, no matter how little, we're moving in the right direction.'",

            "Description": "SINGAPORE - A tech equipment reseller company came close to losing more than $100,000 worth of laptops to a scam.The reseller is now trying to find legitimate buyers for the equipment.The firm thought that it was receiving an order from Nanyang Technological University (NTU) when it got an e-mail from a Mr Daniel Chong on July 18.Mr Chong, who claimed to be from NTU's procurement division, ordered 50 Dell laptops, asking the company to deliver them first to Penanshin Air Express, a freight forwarder.Mr N.P. (not his real name), 53, the tech reseller's co-founder, told The Straits Times: 'When we received the e-mail, we did not think there was anything wrong.'Previously, when NTU launched tenders requesting laptops, we had always participated. So we thought that we were already in their list of prospective vendors and that the e-mail was legitimate.'It was only when Mr Bernard Chan, 44, director of Penanshin Air Express, informed him that the purchase order was fake that Mr N.P. realised he had fallen victim to a business e-mail compromise (BEC) scam.BEC involves the sending of e-mails supposedly from the victims' colleagues, business partners or suppliers.Unknown to the victims, these e-mails are sent by scammers, who have hacked into the e-mail accounts of these business contacts or who are sending them from spoofed e-mail addresses.Between January and June, there were 209 cases of BEC scams reported, with $67.7 million lost, the police said.This is more than thrice the $22.3 million lost to such scams from January to June last year, when 164 cases were reported.Using another alias when he contacted Mr Chan, the scammer had posed as an employee of GP Industries, a Singapore-based battery manufacturer.But when the scammer informed Mr Chan that he would arrange for a courier to pick up and ship the laptops to Britain, the Penanshin Air Express director realised it was a scam. Mr Chan said: 'If I am serving only as a collection point, this means that my company, which helps business owners ship their goods overseas, will not be paid.'After Mr Chan called Mr N.P, the duo realised that there were other discrepancies, such as how despite the scammer's claim of being from NTU, his e-mail address did not use the university's domain name.Mr N.P. said: 'We should have checked the location before shipping out the laptops. It does not make sense for a university to ask us to send laptops it is ordering to the United Kingdom, or even to another location in Singapore.'During Covid-19, we were not doing so well. When we received a big order, we wanted to cash in.'The police said that investigations are ongoing.Ms Linda Teo, country manager of recruitment agency ManpowerGroup Singapore, said that pandemic restrictions may have prevented employees leaving their companies from handing over properly to remaining staff.She said: 'Companies and suppliers that do not keep in regular contact may not be aware of these staff changes, potentially creating gaps in their processes that scammers may take advantage of.' Ms Evelyn Chow, managing director of human resources consultancy DecodeHR, said that due to the pandemic, many employees work from home.'As this has become a norm, accounting staff are likely to be allowed to process payment to external vendors remotely,' she noted.Mr N.P. plans to put in place a new system in his company that will require multiple people to approve every order, instead of just those in the sales department.He said: 'At least the laptops did not leave the country, but we must be more careful now. We will spend the next few months training our staff and setting rules such as requiring a face-to-face meeting before orders are delivered.'",

            "Description": "SINGAPORE - A small group of employees from six leading banks in Singapore now operate from the police’s new Anti-Scam Command office to help the police tackle scam incidents efficiently.These employees from DBS Bank, OCBC, UOB, Standard Chartered, HSBC and CIMB have been helping to trace the flow of funds, and freezing bank accounts involved in scammers’ operations at the new office at the Police Cantonment Complex in New Bridge Road since July 25.Speaking to the media at the opening of the Anti-Scam Command office on Tuesday, Deputy Assistant Commissioner Aileen Yap, the Anti-Scam Command assistant director, said speed is important when dealing with scams.She added: “When there is a live scam case happening, we can now very quickly go to the bank staff located in the office and with their help, carry out very swift interventions.”The opening was attended by Minister for Communications and Information Josephine Teo, who is also Second Minister for Home Affairs, and Minister of State for Home Affairs Sun Xueling.The police said that since the bank employees’ deployment to the Anti-Scam Command office, more than $1.5 million lost in more than 40 separate scam cases have been recovered.The amount retrieved made up more than 60 per cent of the money lost in these cases.The police said having bank employees working at the Anti-Scam Command is a major move forward in its scam-fighting efforts.DBS was the first to send an employee to work with officers at the Anti-Scam Centre in 2019. The bank now has two employees stationed at the Anti-Scam Command.Mr Elvin Lim, group head of investigations at DBS Bank, said: “Our long-standing collaboration (with the police) and belief in the effectiveness of co-locating of bank staff to aid in fund tracing and recovery has resulted in several successful and timely customer interventions, as well as breakthroughs in enforcement action undertaken by the police.”Mr Beaver Chua, head of anti-fraud at OCBC Bank’s Group Financial Crime Compliance department, said: “Having someone stationed on site at the Anti-Scam Command allows us to identify and freeze or block fraudulent transactions and compromised accounts even more quickly.“When a scam is detected, time is of the essence to stop fraudulent funds flows and trace them to afford a higher chance of recovering the scammed funds.”Staff from the Government Technology Agency, or GovTech, are also deployed at the Anti-Scam Command to support police investigations in Singpass-related scams.“This facilitates faster sharing of information required for investigations and enables the police to leverage Singpass fraud analytics capabilities that identify and flag unusual account activities,” said the police. The Anti-Scam Centre was set up as a specialised unit under the Commercial Affairs Department (CAD) in 2019.Last year, the Anti-Scam Division was formed, reorganising and consolidating all scam-fighting units under the CAD.The division was expanded in March to become the Anti-Scam Command, bringing together all scam-fighting units across the entire Singapore Police Force. Individuals who facilitate scam-related activities, such as money mules who help in bank transfers and disclose Singpass and bank credentials to scammers, are also targeted by the Anti-Scam Command, said the police.More than 60 money mules were charged in the last five months, since the command was set up.The Anti-Scam Command has also issued warnings to more than 95,000 individuals, including potential scam victims and those who may have received scam advertisements or messages.Since March, it has coordinated 12 operations, which led to the arrest of more than 3,900 scammers and money mules.According to the mid-year crime statistics released by the police last month, a total of $227.8 million was lost to the top 10 scam types in the first half of this year.More than 14,300 scam cases were reported so far this year, almost double the 7,746 cases reported in the same period last year.",

The offence of unauthorised access to computer material carries a jail term of up to two years, a fine of up to $5,000 or both. Repeat offenders can get jailed for up to three years, fined up to $10,000 or both.Those convicted of assisting another to control benefits of criminal conduct can be jailed for up to 10 years, fined up to $500,000 or both.Those convicted of cheating can be jailed for up to three years, fined or both.",

            "Description": "Follow us on Telegram for the latest updates: https://t.me/mothershipsg A persistent scam variant has emerged, and over a thousand people in Singapore have fallen prey to it this year.The police are alerting members of the public of this scam, where scammers contact victims via phone calls and pretend to be their friends, before asking for money.How do the scams work? Victims typically receive phone calls from unknown numbers with the '+' prefix.When they answer the call, the callers do not identify themselves.Instead, they ask the victim to guess who they are through questions such as 'Guess who am I?' or 'You canât remember me?'.The victim would then give the name of a friend whom they believe the caller's voice to sound the most similar to.The caller would then assume the identity of said friend, claiming to have lost their mobile phone or changed their contact number, and will ask the victim to add their number to their contact list.A few days later, the caller will contact the victim again, this time asking them for a loan due to financial difficulties, or claiming that they've run afoul of the law.Victims typically give their bank account number or phone numbers to transfer money to the 'friend'.They realise they have been scammed after contacting their actual friends the callers had impersonated.The police shared that since January 2022, at least 1,098 victims have fallen prey to such scams, with at least S$4.5million lost in total.Things to note To avoid falling for such scams, the police advises members of the public to follow these precautionary measures:  Beware of calls with the '+' prefix, especially if you are not expecting an international call.  Beware of unusual requests received from phone calls or messages, even if they appear to be from your family or friends.  Verify whether the caller's request is legitimate by checking with your family and friends through alternative means such as physical meet-ups, video calls or email, other than using the contact details on your phone.  For more information on scams, members of the public can visit this website,Â or call the Anti-Scam Hotline at 1800-722-6688.Anyone with information on such scams may call the Police Hotline at 1800-255-0000 or submit information online here.

            "Description": "SINGAPORE - More than 24,500 phone numbers, believed to be used in scams, have been blocked by the ScamShield application, said the police on Monday (Aug 29).Over 5.1 million SMSes have also been reported on the app, which was launched in November 2020 to reduce opportunities for scammers to contact potential victims.The app, managed by the National Crime Prevention Council (NCPC) and the Singapore Police Force, has been downloaded by 300,500 users of iOS devices.More Singaporeans will be able to download the app when it is released on Android devices next month.The app identifies and filters out scam messages and blocks calls from phone numbers that are verified as scam-related, said the police.Apart from reporting scam messages, users will also receive alerts on trending scam tactics.Separately, a revamped quiz to educate retail bank customers on various scams such as bank phishing, investment and job scams, which are among the top 10 scams of concern for the first half of this year, was rolled out on Monday.A total of $227.8 million was lost to the top 10 scams in the first six months of the year, up from the $142.5 million in the same period last year.Job scams have been the leading scam so far this year, with over 3,500 cases reported and more than $58 million lost.The first edition of the Scam Buster Bank Quiz, which was rolled out in 2020, was attempted more than 440,000 times.The police said the revamped quiz features more interactive elements and actual scam examples to educate bank customers on how to spot scams and red flags, and what to do upon receiving such scam messages.'A discerning and well-informed public is the best defence against scams, especially given the increase in scam variants,' said the police, adding that it will continue to work with the NCPC to conduct public education on scams, especially online where most scams are taking place.",

This is more than half of the $633.3 million lost in the whole of last year.There was also a 36 per cent hike in overall crime to 25,593 cases, with a rise in outrage of modesty cases and cyber extortion crimes.'The prevalence of scams continues to be high in Singapore. At least 90 per cent of scams in Singapore originate from overseas,' said the police.'These scammers are typically part of organised criminal groups, and run sophisticated transnational operations which are not easy to detect or dismantle. These scammers are also well-resourced, and adept at using technology to cover their tracks.'The police said job scams, phishing scams, e-commerce scams and investment scams remain of particular concern, with reports of such scams making up 74.5 per cent of the top 10 scam types in the first half of this year.Job scams, the fifth scam of concern during the same period last year, is now the most concerning.A common variant of the scam is tricking a victim to 'help' e-commerce platform merchants improve their sales by making advance purchases. The victims are assured that their money would eventually be refunded and a commission would be paid to them.The scammers would initially refund the victims the cost of the items and pay them commissions. They would later claim to have encountered issues with the refunds and would stop paying the victims.Phishing scams recorded the second highest number of cases among all scam types. More than 2,300 cases were reported and the total amount lost was $7.8 million.In banking-related phishing scams, the culprits would impersonate a bank or government official and pretend to assist victims with issues concerning their bank cards or accounts.They would then convince the victims to provide their account details and one-time passwords. There was a spike in the number of e-commerce scams reported, from 1,057 cases during the first half of last year to 2,267 this year.The police said e-commerce scams generally involve the sale of goods online without delivering the items after payment is made.'The increase in e-commerce scams is largely due to rental scams involving fake property listings, which made up 29.6 per cent of e-commerce scams.' The police said their Anti-Scam Centre froze more than 7,800 bank accounts and recovered close to $80 million in the first half of the year, which was about 31.4 per cent of the total amount scammed.'The Anti-Scam Centre also works closely with local telecommunication companies to terminate mobile lines which are found to have been used for scams, as well as with social media platforms and online marketplaces to remove suspicious accounts and advertisements,' they added.Meanwhile, victims of cyber extortion lost more than $754,000, as cases rose to 203 from the previous 138. In these cases, criminals would typically befriend victims online and subsequently coax them into performing compromising or indecent acts in front of a camera. The footage or images would then be used to extort money from the victims.Instagram was observed to be the most common platform used to approach victims, followed by Facebook and Tinder, said the police.Outrage of modesty cases went up to 773 from 739, while cases of voyeurism decreased to 216 from 236.Housebreaking and related crimes dropped to 77 from 88 cases while the number of robbery cases decreased to seven from 16 cases in the same period last year.This is the lowest mid-year figure for housebreaking and robbery cases in the past 10 years, said the police.",

            "Description": "SINGAPORE - He was told over the phone by someone claiming to be a court official that he was involved in illegal money laundering activities, and while John (not his real name) knew he had done nothing wrong, fear set in.After a series of phone calls with the 'court official' as well as 'police officers' and even an 'auditor' claiming to be from the Monetary Authority of Singapore, the 58-year-old, who works in financial services, grew so worried he gave up personal information, including his bank account details.Using his banking credentials, the scammers transferred $93,000 out of his account, and it would have been much more if not for a member of the DBS anti-scam team, who flagged the initial transaction as suspicious.John, who is married with two children in their 20s, had fallen victim to a government official impersonation scam.In response to The Straits Times’ queries, the police said 996 government official impersonation scam cases were reported in the first half of this year. Victims of such scams were cheated of $25.2 million.Recalling the incident in June, John said last Friday (Aug 26): 'The scammers had Singaporean accents. It also seemed like they were authority figures I could trust. It was all very convincing.'He added: 'The 'court official' first accused me of money laundering activities that were carried out through a company which I set up. When I told him I had no knowledge of such activities, he transferred me to a 'police officer' who said he needed my information.'Hoping to the resolve the matter quickly, John, who has lived in Singapore for 16 years, took a photo of his employment pass card and sent it to the scammer.'He then sent me a very official-looking court document for the offences I'd been accused of and said due the seriousness of the offences, the police would be at my home that evening to arrest me,' John said.'I was extremely fearful. There was also this time pressure. If I didn't get my name cleared by then, I was going to spend an evening in a jail cell.'John said the scammers used the tactic of confusion, transferring him to different authority figures, including a court official, a junior police officer, a senior police inspector and a financial auditor who claimed to be from the Monetary Authority of Singapore.He eventually handed over his DBS banking credentials to the scammers for inspection.'I was told not to speak to anyone about this - not my employer, not my wife. Otherwise it would jeopardise the legitimacy of the financial review. They said not to talk to the police or any banks about this as they suspected that the criminals involved in the money laundering activities were employees of the bank.'At that point I was even wondering if I was being followed or watched, so I took their instructions very seriously,' said John.The scammers used his banking credentials to transfer $93,000 from his account and attempted a second transfer of $97,800. Ms Elaine Tan, a member of the DBS anti-scam team, said the bank's fraud surveillance systems flagged the second transaction as suspicious.'The biggest red flag was that John wasn't aware of the $93,000 transfer when I spoke to him over the phone to verify the transaction,' Ms Tan said.'In fact, he claimed that he did not access his DBS internet banking that day, let alone add a new payee or make a funds transfer.'Believing John had been scammed, Ms Tan informed the Anti-Scam Centre.Assistant Superintendent of Police (ASP) Simon Lam, a senior investigation officer at the Anti-Scam Centre, said subsequent transfers of around $1 million were in the process of being transferred from John's account at the time.He contacted John and took two hours to convince him that he had been scammed.'(We finally) achieved a breakthrough with the use of a news article which elaborated on the modus operandi of a government official impersonation scam, which was similar to what the victim experienced,' said ASP Lam. Subsequent transfer attempts by the scammers were halted and the first transfer of $93,000 was also recovered.ASP Lam added: “This is a testament of the strong collaborative relationship between DBS and the Anti-Scam Centre in our capabilities to respond swiftly to scam incidents and underscores our commitment to protect the community.”John is grateful that the money he saved for retirement remains intact.“I had seen the advisories on scams. Despite  that, the speed at which the events unfolded after the first call got me sucked in. I didn’t stop to think... It was the ultimate act of stupidity for me to fall for this,” he said.",

            "Description": "SINGAPORE - At least 997 people here have lost a total of $3.9 million since January after they fell victim to scammers posing as property agents, the police said on Friday (Aug 26).There has been a resurgence of scammers impersonating legitimate property agents and asking victims for payment to secure the rental of a unit before viewing the property, according to the police advisory.The police said victims would typically respond to online property listings and initiate a conversation with the scammers via WhatsApp using the contact numbers in the fake listings.During the conversation, the scammer posing as a registered property agent would convince the victim of his credentials by sending a photo of the agent's business card and pictures or videos of the property to be leased.The scammer would then ask for the victim's personal details to prepare the lease agreement.When the victims asked if they could view the property, the scammers would claim that the landlord was unavailable. To add an air of legitimacy, the scammers would send a copy of the lease agreement with the name and NRIC of the purported owner of the unit to the victims for them to sign.After signing, the victims would be instructed to make payment for various reasons such as rental deposits, stamp duty, or other fees to secure the rental.They would discover that they had been cheated only after the scammers ceased contact with them, or when they reached out to the legitimate property agents through other means.The police advised members of the public to adopt precautionary measures such as verifying the legitimacy of a property listing.They can do so by liaising with a property agent using only the agent's phone number registered on the Council for Estate Agencies' (CEA) public register. Members of the public may check whether a property agent is registered with the CEA by searching for the agent's phone number on the register.If the search does not lead to the property agent's profile page, it means the agent has not registered that phone number with the CEA and the listing may be fake.The public can also contact the agent's property agency to verify the authenticity of the listing.Members of the public are also urged to beware of calls with the '+' prefix that originate from overseas, not to make any payments before a property viewing, and not to disclose personal information, credit card and bank details or passwords, including one-time passwords, to anyone.Anyone with information related to such scams can call the police hotline at 1800-255-0000, or submit an online report at this website.",

            "Description": "SINGAPORE: Small business owner Dayana Rizal, 27, is no stranger to dealing with online buyers, but the one she encountered on Oct 3 seemed particularly - in her words - 'harmless'.Ms Dayana, who sold clay mugs on her now-defunct Instagram page potekceramics, said the buyer was a sweet talker who seemed clueless about how to purchase her mugs online.The buyer, using a private Instagram account with a few hundred followers, sent Ms Dayana a direct message with a screenshot of her wares, saying: 'I want to buy this.''There were multiple items inside (the screenshot), so in my head I was thinking like, there are so many (products) inside - which one do you want to buy?' Ms Dayana told CNA, recalling her exchange with the buyer during some lull time at work.'So I just assumed it was like a clueless makcik or aunty who was blur and didn't know how to order through Instagram. I think I let my guard down also because the person behind the account was calling me 'dear' and all that.' Ms Dayana, who works in a pottery studio and conducts workshops, then referred the buyer to her website, asking them to check what was available and complete the purchase there. But the buyer insisted on buying through Instagram.'I guess she really doesn't know how to use the computer,' Ms Dayana remembered thinking then, laughing at her own naivete. 'I sound so stupid now that I'm recounting it.'I was honestly trying to close the sale because it's always exciting when someone wants to buy your stuff,' she added. 'But also I wanted to help her; not everyone knows how to use a website.'Ms Dayana relented, telling the buyer they could send the money to her mobile number. The buyer then asked how much it would cost to deliver to Yishun, so Ms Dayana replied that it was a S$5 delivery fee islandwide.The buyer's next question, however, led to the first red flag.The buyer asked if she was the owner or admin of the potekceramics Instagram page, ostensibly to verify that they were dealing with the business owner. Ms Dayana confirmed that she owned the business.'She was like, okay, just to make sure, I'll send in a request to Instagram to send you a message just to check whether you're the real owner or not. Once you receive the message, can you send me a screenshot? Then I'll make the PayNow to your number,' she said.What Ms Dayana did not realise was that the buyer was actually using Instagram's password reset function to take over her account.Ms Dayana then got a text message from Facebook with a link to reset her Instagram password. Without 'thinking' or scrutinising the message, she took a screenshot of it and forwarded it to the buyer.'I didn't look at it carefully. I thought it was just like a message from Facebook to verify that I'm the real owner,' she said, admitting that the official nature of the message threw her off, and that it was so quick and easy to take a screenshot of a message and pass it on.'I was really clouded by, one, I wanted to close the sale. Secondly, I just thought she was a harmless aunty. I thought she didn't want to be scammed, and I understood also because I didn't want to be scammed.'But in the end, I also got scammed.'SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS TARGETEDOther small business owners have encountered buyers who try to use this seemingly simple method of taking over an Instagram account.On Sep 21, the owner of handmade jewellery business Ellaie took to TikTok to recount how she was almost deceived by the same ruse, saying in a video that the buyer who tried it was very 'unassuming'.A Straits Times report on Oct 2 also detailed how a man who sold kueh lapis on Instagram fell victim to the method, losing access to his account and a large number of his 5,000 followers, some of them loyal customers. After Ms Dayana sent the buyer the screenshot of the message, they said thanks and she did not think much about it. But less than an hour later, when she opened her Instagram app, a pop-up said she had been logged out.Ms Dayana went back to that official message Facebook had sent, and realised that it was a link to reset her password. She tried the link but it did not work.She then tried using her username and phone number to sign in to her page, but the app said the username and number did not exist. She realised that she had lost all access to her Instagram page.Ms Dayana was panicking at this point, especially as the person who took over her page had blocked her personal account from viewing it too. She tried using Instagram's account recovery function, which asked her to send a video selfie to confirm her identity. Instagram emailed her on the same day saying it could not identify her, asking her to submit another video. She has not done so and has not received any word from Instagram since.Ms Dayana said she got frustrated.'I shouldn't have to put in so much effort to try and get back my account. I kind of want Instagram to take down the account,' she said, adding that she plans to reach out to Instagram and browse Reddit for tips.A quick check by CNA on Oct 13 confirmed that the potekceramics page - now with a slightly modified page name - remains online, although the scam posts have been deleted. Meta, Instagram's parent company, did not respond to requests for comment.SCAM POSTSMs Dayana's friends sent her updates about her page, saying that the new owner was posting investment-related scams and sending direct messages to her followers about it.Some of the scam posts were plastered on a picture of Ms Dayana and her boyfriend, which she believes was downloaded off her highlights reel. She found this 'creepy'.Ms Dayana's friends reported the account to Instagram and blocked it in hopes of flagging it as being hacked. Some of them also messaged the new owner, telling them to give it up.The new owner was brazen in their response, Ms Dayana said, adding that they 'liked' the angry messages and told her friends to stop wasting their time.'It just felt like a bit more targeted and quite personal,' she said. 'Not like a random robot that's trying to scam you.' One friend said that one creator she follows had also been approached with the same tactics by the same buyer on the same day that Ms Dayana was fooled.Ms Dayana said she was not worried about losing customers, highlighting that her pottery friends with large followings had posted about the incident and pointed her followers to her new Instagram page, potekceramic.Her old page, started in early 2021, had about 600 followers.'I didn't want my brand to be associated with this kind of scam, so that's why I didn't really bother trying to recover that account. Because to me, it's already tainted. So, I already created a new account just to start afresh,' she said.'I'm not that worried about losing followers because I know that those who really care about my brand and the work that I make will find me one way or another.''JUST BE A BIT MORE PRESENT'Ms Dayana said she is considering making a police report but acknowledged that she has got over the frustration of losing her account. She said she is telling her story so others do not fall for the same trap.'You know, life is more than just Instagram, so I've been busy like actually working,' she said.Ms Dayana said the incident has left her wary of doing business through direct messages on Instagram, adding that she recently removed a 'weird' follower and blocked them out of caution.She advised small business owners who deal over Instagram to really look into a buyer's account and be vigilant of what they are asking for.'Don't get so into the moment when you want to make a sale. Just be a bit more present,' she said, adding that she felt 'greedy' at the point of getting tricked.'Even if the message is from Facebook, I think other people should read carefully about what the message is telling them to do.'"

            "Description": "SINGAPORE: The Singapore Police Force (SPF) on Sunday (Oct 2) warned of a new variant of SMS phishing scams where scammers would target victims with similar sender's ID to obtain their Singpass login credentials. In a news release, the police said they have seen a surge in cases where people would receive unsolicited SMSes with the sender's ID containing similarities to Singpass, such as MySingpass or SGSingpass. The SMSes would indicate that the recipients’ Singpass accounts had been or would be deactivated, and that they were required to conduct facial verification. They would then be required to log into Singpass through a web link provided in the messages. Upon clicking on the link, the victims would be directed to a spoofed Singpass login webpage, where they would be required to enter their Singpass ID and password.They would then be led to a two-factor authentication page asking for their Singpass one-time password, said the police. The victims would only realise they were scammed when they received alerts from Singpass that their profiles were updated. In some cases, the victims would receive alerts that they had signed up for bank accounts and credit cards. In some cases, unauthorised transactions were also charged to the credit cards.'While the authorities have taken down the phishing websites, user vigilance is crucial in our fight against evolving scams,' said the police. SINGPASS DOES NOT SEND SMSES CONTAINING WEB LINKS'The police and GovTech would like to advise members of the public to be on heightened alert,' said the authorities. Members of the public were advised that Singpass does not send SMSes containing web links asking recipients to log in with their credentials, such as passwords and one-time passwords. The official SMS' sender identity is labelled as Singpass or SingPass. Singpass users can verify the authenticity of the claims against their Singpass account via the Singpass hotline at 6335 3533 and press 9 for 24-hour scam support. They should also ensure that the Singpass website domain they are accessing is singpass.gov.sg, with a 'lock' icon in the address bar. Users were also advised to update their contact details registered with Singpass and enable notifications via their Singpass app so that they can be promptly alerted of suspicious logins, such as when a login on a new device or Internet browser is detected.'If you suspect that your Singpass account has been compromised, reset your Singpass password immediately,' said the police. Log-ins to Government services should only be done at websites with domains ending with '.gov.sg'. If a link received does not end with '.gov.sg', users should check it against the list of trusted websites at www.gov.sg/trusted-sites. The police also advised users to never disclose their personal or Internet banking details and one-time passwords to anyone and to report any fraudulent transactions to their bank immediately."

            "Description": "SINGAPORE - Android users can now download an app called ScamShield, which can block calls from blacklisted numbers that have been verified as scam-related.The app, which can also identify scam SMSes, is available on Google Play Store.It has been available to iOS users since November 2020.The Android version was officially launched on Wednesday by Senior Minister and Coordinating Minister for National Security Teo Chee Hean and Minister of State for Home Affairs and Social and Family Development Sun Xueling, during a dinner to commemorate the National Crime Prevention Council's (NCPC) 40th anniversary at Sands Expo and Convention Centre.The app, developed by NCPC and Open Government Products, a division of the Government Technology Agency (GovTech), blocks calls from a database that is managed by NCPC and the police. It was soft-launched on Sept 1. While the Android version has almost the same features as the iOS one - such as blocking and reporting scam messages and calls - the iOS version is able to divert scam messages to a junk folder, while the Android version only notifies users of them.This is due to specific limitations of the Android operating system, the police said on Wednesday.Scam SMSes detected by ScamShield are sent to NCPC and the police for collation, which the police said helps keep the app updated, to better protect users from scam calls and messages.The police said that as at Sept 14, the ScamShield's iOS version has been downloaded by more than 315,000 users and has resulted in more than 5.8 million SMSes being reported, and more than 29,000 phone numbers, believed to be used for scam calls, blocked.In January, NCPC chairman Gerald Singham responded to a forum letter in The Straits Times which asked about the progress of ScamShield for Android phones.Mr Singham said that while it had been earlier announced that the version would be available at the end of 2021, timelines were delayed as GovTech had to reprioritise resources towards supporting the Government's response to Covid-19.",

'But I got some money (S$11) credited to me. So I was like 'ok sure, let's proceed'.'Unfortunately, things went downhill from there. After that first transaction, Chang informed her that to continue rating the airlines, she would have to top up some money into the online platform. This would be used to pay the merchants so the platform could continue offering this service, she explained. Lina complied.But as she continued to make increasingly large payments â each one to a different bank account â Lina began to face problems.When she attempted to withdraw her earnings, she received an error message informing her that she had to complete another rating first.And after she did so, she was told that she had to top up even more money before she could make a withdrawal. The platform, which calls itself Aeroclass.org. The real Aeroclass.org appears to be an aviation training website. Photo courtesy of Lina.By then, Lina no longer cared about earning commissions â she just wanted to get her initial 'investment' back. She said:'But eventually, I still cannot (sic) save myself.' Her sixth and final transaction was a deposit of S$20,104 on Sep. 20, the day after after she received that first message.In total, she lost S$34,226 in just two days. Screenshot of Chang's latest message to Lina, sent on Sep. 26. Photo courtesy of Lina.Still received messages When she realised she had fallen victim to a scam, she was 'very upset and desperate', she shared.This was especially since she'd borrowed money from her mother as capital for the so-called investment.As Chang continued to send her increasingly urgent messages, asking her to top up even more money â S$42,000 â to retrieve her deposit, she felt torn.'The urge to top up was there, but I really didn't have the money to continue,' she said.Instead, Lina decided to file a police report on Sep. 21. 'They told me the money is as [good as] gone,' she said.'And I don't think the bank will give me the money out of goodwill. So now it's just... I don't know.'Her family still does not know about the scam.The police confirmed that a report was lodged and investigations are ongoing.No red flags Lina shared that previously, she had done other legitimate surveys to earn money.The scam was also made more believable by the fact that she was added into a group chat with several other 'employees'. The participants would text in that chat daily, reporting how much they earned that day.'I don't know if they are victims like me or simply admins,' she admitted.For now, Lina hopes to use her income from her regular job to slowly pay her mother back. The first few days after the scam, she suffered from panic attacks â but she has been gradually coming to terms with the events.She also hopes her ordeal can help spread awareness among the public.'It is not just older aunties or uncles getting scammed, but it has also come to the younger generation,' she said.She added:'[These scammers] make people feel like just killing themselves... the sums are too huge.'

            "Description": "SINGAPORE - When a flustered man walked into UOB Bank's main branch trying to bank in a cheque of more than $150,000 to an offshore account, service associate Jenny Hong got suspicious.The first telltale sign was the name of the account holder and the account number did not match, she said.When Ms Hong, 46, probed the man, in his 70s, further and asked why he needed to send money to the overseas account, he grew more rattled.The incident happened earlier this year at the bank's main branch in Raffles Place.Ms Hong said: 'It was odd because he was trying to bank in such a large amount of money into an account that was not his. He kept saying it was very urgent and when I asked him more about it, his answers grew more and more incoherent.'Sensing something amiss, Ms Hong, who has worked at UOB for 27 years, flagged the incident to the bank's assistant branch manager Alison Cheng.They then realised the man was being scammed.Ms Cheng, 55, said: 'He said the money was for his girlfriend in The Netherlands.'He told me he had just met her on Facebook and knew her for two months. She insisted she needed his money to complete a business deal and get commission from it.'At that point, Ms Cheng's aim was to convince the man he was being scammed and persuade him to halt the transfer.'I asked if he had seen scam articles in the news. He said yes, but insisted he was not being scammed.'He said it was love and his girlfriend needed the money urgently,' recounted Ms Cheng.She spent the next half an hour convincing him about scams and it was only then did he understand he had almost become a victim of an Internet love scam.Ms Cheng added: 'The man was suddenly resolute and told us not to carry out the transaction.'He also made a police report. According to the mid-year crime statistics released by the police last month, more than $20 million was lost to Internet love scams in the first six months of the year.There were 477 cases in the first half of 2022, a dip from the 546 cases during the same period last year.Mr Richard Soh, group head of integrated fraud management at UOB, said staff at bank branches are trained to spot telltale signs of suspicious transactions and take appropriate actions to handle them.'These include dissuading customers from sanctioning questionable transactions and assisting them to report scams to the police,' he said.National University of Singapore business professor Lawrence Loh said it is assuring the preventive measures against scams are not just a part of an abstract policy, but have been internalised in financial institutions here.More of such interventions will sustain the confidence level of overseas investors in our financial hub, he noted.Prof Loh, whose expertise is on strategy and policy, added: 'Every scam case can add up to the small hit that scams as a whole may have on Singapore's reputation as a financial hub.'So, if we can eradicate whatever impact scams have on our reputation, no matter how little, we're moving in the right direction.'",

            "Description": "SINGAPORE - A tech equipment reseller company came close to losing more than $100,000 worth of laptops to a scam.The reseller is now trying to find legitimate buyers for the equipment.The firm thought that it was receiving an order from Nanyang Technological University (NTU) when it got an e-mail from a Mr Daniel Chong on July 18.Mr Chong, who claimed to be from NTU's procurement division, ordered 50 Dell laptops, asking the company to deliver them first to Penanshin Air Express, a freight forwarder.Mr N.P. (not his real name), 53, the tech reseller's co-founder, told The Straits Times: 'When we received the e-mail, we did not think there was anything wrong.'Previously, when NTU launched tenders requesting laptops, we had always participated. So we thought that we were already in their list of prospective vendors and that the e-mail was legitimate.'It was only when Mr Bernard Chan, 44, director of Penanshin Air Express, informed him that the purchase order was fake that Mr N.P. realised he had fallen victim to a business e-mail compromise (BEC) scam.BEC involves the sending of e-mails supposedly from the victims' colleagues, business partners or suppliers.Unknown to the victims, these e-mails are sent by scammers, who have hacked into the e-mail accounts of these business contacts or who are sending them from spoofed e-mail addresses.Between January and June, there were 209 cases of BEC scams reported, with $67.7 million lost, the police said.This is more than thrice the $22.3 million lost to such scams from January to June last year, when 164 cases were reported.Using another alias when he contacted Mr Chan, the scammer had posed as an employee of GP Industries, a Singapore-based battery manufacturer.But when the scammer informed Mr Chan that he would arrange for a courier to pick up and ship the laptops to Britain, the Penanshin Air Express director realised it was a scam. Mr Chan said: 'If I am serving only as a collection point, this means that my company, which helps business owners ship their goods overseas, will not be paid.'After Mr Chan called Mr N.P, the duo realised that there were other discrepancies, such as how despite the scammer's claim of being from NTU, his e-mail address did not use the university's domain name.Mr N.P. said: 'We should have checked the location before shipping out the laptops. It does not make sense for a university to ask us to send laptops it is ordering to the United Kingdom, or even to another location in Singapore.'During Covid-19, we were not doing so well. When we received a big order, we wanted to cash in.'The police said that investigations are ongoing.Ms Linda Teo, country manager of recruitment agency ManpowerGroup Singapore, said that pandemic restrictions may have prevented employees leaving their companies from handing over properly to remaining staff.She said: 'Companies and suppliers that do not keep in regular contact may not be aware of these staff changes, potentially creating gaps in their processes that scammers may take advantage of.' Ms Evelyn Chow, managing director of human resources consultancy DecodeHR, said that due to the pandemic, many employees work from home.'As this has become a norm, accounting staff are likely to be allowed to process payment to external vendors remotely,' she noted.Mr N.P. plans to put in place a new system in his company that will require multiple people to approve every order, instead of just those in the sales department.He said: 'At least the laptops did not leave the country, but we must be more careful now. We will spend the next few months training our staff and setting rules such as requiring a face-to-face meeting before orders are delivered.'",

            "Description": "SINGAPORE - A small group of employees from six leading banks in Singapore now operate from the police’s new Anti-Scam Command office to help the police tackle scam incidents efficiently.These employees from DBS Bank, OCBC, UOB, Standard Chartered, HSBC and CIMB have been helping to trace the flow of funds, and freezing bank accounts involved in scammers’ operations at the new office at the Police Cantonment Complex in New Bridge Road since July 25.Speaking to the media at the opening of the Anti-Scam Command office on Tuesday, Deputy Assistant Commissioner Aileen Yap, the Anti-Scam Command assistant director, said speed is important when dealing with scams.She added: “When there is a live scam case happening, we can now very quickly go to the bank staff located in the office and with their help, carry out very swift interventions.”The opening was attended by Minister for Communications and Information Josephine Teo, who is also Second Minister for Home Affairs, and Minister of State for Home Affairs Sun Xueling.The police said that since the bank employees’ deployment to the Anti-Scam Command office, more than $1.5 million lost in more than 40 separate scam cases have been recovered.The amount retrieved made up more than 60 per cent of the money lost in these cases.The police said having bank employees working at the Anti-Scam Command is a major move forward in its scam-fighting efforts.DBS was the first to send an employee to work with officers at the Anti-Scam Centre in 2019. The bank now has two employees stationed at the Anti-Scam Command.Mr Elvin Lim, group head of investigations at DBS Bank, said: “Our long-standing collaboration (with the police) and belief in the effectiveness of co-locating of bank staff to aid in fund tracing and recovery has resulted in several successful and timely customer interventions, as well as breakthroughs in enforcement action undertaken by the police.”Mr Beaver Chua, head of anti-fraud at OCBC Bank’s Group Financial Crime Compliance department, said: “Having someone stationed on site at the Anti-Scam Command allows us to identify and freeze or block fraudulent transactions and compromised accounts even more quickly.“When a scam is detected, time is of the essence to stop fraudulent funds flows and trace them to afford a higher chance of recovering the scammed funds.”Staff from the Government Technology Agency, or GovTech, are also deployed at the Anti-Scam Command to support police investigations in Singpass-related scams.“This facilitates faster sharing of information required for investigations and enables the police to leverage Singpass fraud analytics capabilities that identify and flag unusual account activities,” said the police. The Anti-Scam Centre was set up as a specialised unit under the Commercial Affairs Department (CAD) in 2019.Last year, the Anti-Scam Division was formed, reorganising and consolidating all scam-fighting units under the CAD.The division was expanded in March to become the Anti-Scam Command, bringing together all scam-fighting units across the entire Singapore Police Force. Individuals who facilitate scam-related activities, such as money mules who help in bank transfers and disclose Singpass and bank credentials to scammers, are also targeted by the Anti-Scam Command, said the police.More than 60 money mules were charged in the last five months, since the command was set up.The Anti-Scam Command has also issued warnings to more than 95,000 individuals, including potential scam victims and those who may have received scam advertisements or messages.Since March, it has coordinated 12 operations, which led to the arrest of more than 3,900 scammers and money mules.According to the mid-year crime statistics released by the police last month, a total of $227.8 million was lost to the top 10 scam types in the first half of this year.More than 14,300 scam cases were reported so far this year, almost double the 7,746 cases reported in the same period last year.",

Victims typically receive phone calls from unknown numbers with the '+' prefix.When they answer the call, the callers do not identify themselves.Instead, they ask the victim to guess who they are through questions such as 'Guess who am I?' or 'You canât remember me?'.The victim would then give the name of a friend whom they believe the caller's voice to sound the most similar to.The caller would then assume the identity of said friend, claiming to have lost their mobile phone or changed their contact number, and will ask the victim to add their number to their contact list.A few days later, the caller will contact the victim again, this time asking them for a loan due to financial difficulties, or claiming that they've run afoul of the law.Victims typically give their bank account number or phone numbers to transfer money to the 'friend'.They realise they have been scammed after contacting their actual friends the callers had impersonated.The police shared that since January 2022, at least 1,098 victims have fallen prey to such scams, with at least S$4.5million lost in total.Things to note To avoid falling for such scams, the police advises members of the public to follow these precautionary measures:  Beware of calls with the '+' prefix, especially if you are not expecting an international call.  Beware of unusual requests received from phone calls or messages, even if they appear to be from your family or friends.  Verify whether the caller's request is legitimate by checking with your family and friends through alternative means such as physical meet-ups, video calls or email, other than using the contact details on your phone.

This is more than half of the $633.3 million lost in the whole of last year.There was also a 36 per cent hike in overall crime to 25,593 cases, with a rise in outrage of modesty cases and cyber extortion crimes.'The prevalence of scams continues to be high in Singapore. At least 90 per cent of scams in Singapore originate from overseas,' said the police.'These scammers are typically part of organised criminal groups, and run sophisticated transnational operations which are not easy to detect or dismantle. These scammers are also well-resourced, and adept at using technology to cover their tracks.'The police said job scams, phishing scams, e-commerce scams and investment scams remain of particular concern, with reports of such scams making up 74.5 per cent of the top 10 scam types in the first half of this year.Job scams, the fifth scam of concern during the same period last year, is now the most concerning.A common variant of the scam is tricking a victim to 'help' e-commerce platform merchants improve their sales by making advance purchases. The victims are assured that their money would eventually be refunded and a commission would be paid to them.The scammers would initially refund the victims the cost of the items and pay them commissions. They would later claim to have encountered issues with the refunds and would stop paying the victims.Phishing scams recorded the second highest number of cases among all scam types. More than 2,300 cases were reported and the total amount lost was $7.8 million.In banking-related phishing scams, the culprits would impersonate a bank or government official and pretend to assist victims with issues concerning their bank cards or accounts.They would then convince the victims to provide their account details and one-time passwords. There was a spike in the number of e-commerce scams reported, from 1,057 cases during the first half of last year to 2,267 this year.The police said e-commerce scams generally involve the sale of goods online without delivering the items after payment is made.'The increase in e-commerce scams is largely due to rental scams involving fake property listings, which made up 29.6 per cent of e-commerce scams.' The police said their Anti-Scam Centre froze more than 7,800 bank accounts and recovered close to $80 million in the first half of the year, which was about 31.4 per cent of the total amount scammed.'The Anti-Scam Centre also works closely with local telecommunication companies to terminate mobile lines which are found to have been used for scams, as well as with social media platforms and online marketplaces to remove suspicious accounts and advertisements,' they added.Meanwhile, victims of cyber extortion lost more than $754,000, as cases rose to 203 from the previous 138. In these cases, criminals would typically befriend victims online and subsequently coax them into performing compromising or indecent acts in front of a camera. The footage or images would then be used to extort money from the victims.Instagram was observed to be the most common platform used to approach victims, followed by Facebook and Tinder, said the police.Outrage of modesty cases went up to 773 from 739, while cases of voyeurism decreased to 216 from 236.Housebreaking and related crimes dropped to 77 from 88 cases while the number of robbery cases decreased to seven from 16 cases in the same period last year.This is the lowest mid-year figure for housebreaking and robbery cases in the past 10 years, said the police.",

            "Description": "SINGAPORE - He was told over the phone by someone claiming to be a court official that he was involved in illegal money laundering activities, and while John (not his real name) knew he had done nothing wrong, fear set in.After a series of phone calls with the 'court official' as well as 'police officers' and even an 'auditor' claiming to be from the Monetary Authority of Singapore, the 58-year-old, who works in financial services, grew so worried he gave up personal information, including his bank account details.Using his banking credentials, the scammers transferred $93,000 out of his account, and it would have been much more if not for a member of the DBS anti-scam team, who flagged the initial transaction as suspicious.John, who is married with two children in their 20s, had fallen victim to a government official impersonation scam.In response to The Straits Times’ queries, the police said 996 government official impersonation scam cases were reported in the first half of this year. Victims of such scams were cheated of $25.2 million.Recalling the incident in June, John said last Friday (Aug 26): 'The scammers had Singaporean accents. It also seemed like they were authority figures I could trust. It was all very convincing.'He added: 'The 'court official' first accused me of money laundering activities that were carried out through a company which I set up. When I told him I had no knowledge of such activities, he transferred me to a 'police officer' who said he needed my information.'Hoping to the resolve the matter quickly, John, who has lived in Singapore for 16 years, took a photo of his employment pass card and sent it to the scammer.'He then sent me a very official-looking court document for the offences I'd been accused of and said due the seriousness of the offences, the police would be at my home that evening to arrest me,' John said.'I was extremely fearful. There was also this time pressure. If I didn't get my name cleared by then, I was going to spend an evening in a jail cell.'John said the scammers used the tactic of confusion, transferring him to different authority figures, including a court official, a junior police officer, a senior police inspector and a financial auditor who claimed to be from the Monetary Authority of Singapore.He eventually handed over his DBS banking credentials to the scammers for inspection.'I was told not to speak to anyone about this - not my employer, not my wife. Otherwise it would jeopardise the legitimacy of the financial review. They said not to talk to the police or any banks about this as they suspected that the criminals involved in the money laundering activities were employees of the bank.'At that point I was even wondering if I was being followed or watched, so I took their instructions very seriously,' said John.The scammers used his banking credentials to transfer $93,000 from his account and attempted a second transfer of $97,800. Ms Elaine Tan, a member of the DBS anti-scam team, said the bank's fraud surveillance systems flagged the second transaction as suspicious.'The biggest red flag was that John wasn't aware of the $93,000 transfer when I spoke to him over the phone to verify the transaction,' Ms Tan said.'In fact, he claimed that he did not access his DBS internet banking that day, let alone add a new payee or make a funds transfer.'Believing John had been scammed, Ms Tan informed the Anti-Scam Centre.Assistant Superintendent of Police (ASP) Simon Lam, a senior investigation officer at the Anti-Scam Centre, said subsequent transfers of around $1 million were in the process of being transferred from John's account at the time.He contacted John and took two hours to convince him that he had been scammed.'(We finally) achieved a breakthrough with the use of a news article which elaborated on the modus operandi of a government official impersonation scam, which was similar to what the victim experienced,' said ASP Lam. Subsequent transfer attempts by the scammers were halted and the first transfer of $93,000 was also recovered.ASP Lam added: “This is a testament of the strong collaborative relationship between DBS and the Anti-Scam Centre in our capabilities to respond swiftly to scam incidents and underscores our commitment to protect the community.”John is grateful that the money he saved for retirement remains intact.“I had seen the advisories on scams. Despite  that, the speed at which the events unfolded after the first call got me sucked in. I didn’t stop to think... It was the ultimate act of stupidity for me to fall for this,” he said.",

            "Description": "SINGAPORE - At least 997 people here have lost a total of $3.9 million since January after they fell victim to scammers posing as property agents, the police said on Friday (Aug 26).There has been a resurgence of scammers impersonating legitimate property agents and asking victims for payment to secure the rental of a unit before viewing the property, according to the police advisory.The police said victims would typically respond to online property listings and initiate a conversation with the scammers via WhatsApp using the contact numbers in the fake listings.During the conversation, the scammer posing as a registered property agent would convince the victim of his credentials by sending a photo of the agent's business card and pictures or videos of the property to be leased.The scammer would then ask for the victim's personal details to prepare the lease agreement.When the victims asked if they could view the property, the scammers would claim that the landlord was unavailable. To add an air of legitimacy, the scammers would send a copy of the lease agreement with the name and NRIC of the purported owner of the unit to the victims for them to sign.After signing, the victims would be instructed to make payment for various reasons such as rental deposits, stamp duty, or other fees to secure the rental.They would discover that they had been cheated only after the scammers ceased contact with them, or when they reached out to the legitimate property agents through other means.The police advised members of the public to adopt precautionary measures such as verifying the legitimacy of a property listing.They can do so by liaising with a property agent using only the agent's phone number registered on the Council for Estate Agencies' (CEA) public register. Members of the public may check whether a property agent is registered with the CEA by searching for the agent's phone number on the register.If the search does not lead to the property agent's profile page, it means the agent has not registered that phone number with the CEA and the listing may be fake.The public can also contact the agent's property agency to verify the authenticity of the listing.Members of the public are also urged to beware of calls with the '+' prefix that originate from overseas, not to make any payments before a property viewing, and not to disclose personal information, credit card and bank details or passwords, including one-time passwords, to anyone.Anyone with information related to such scams can call the police hotline at 1800-255-0000, or submit an online report at this website.",

            "Description": "SINGAPORE - In the first three months of 2022, around 93 victims lost at least $56.2 million to business e-mail compromise (BEC) scams, said the police on Friday (July 29).This sum is almost 10 per cent of the $633.3 million lost to all scams in Singapore in 2021.BEC involves the sending of e-mails supposedly from the victims' colleagues, business partners or suppliers informing them of a change to their company's bank account number.Unknown to the victims, these e-mails are sent by scammers, who have hacked into the e-mails of these business contacts or who are sending them from spoofed e-mail addresses.On Friday, the police said its Anti-Scam Centre worked with DBS Bank to recover more than US$10 million (S$13.7 million) for a United States-based victim in the financial industry.The victim had been duped into making several large transactions amounting to US$14m to bank accounts held with DBS, by spoofing e-mails purportedly from the victim's client.The recovery, which was done on May 2, is the largest sum the authorities have recovered from a single case.The police said: 'The Anti-Scam Centre received a report on the case and immediately worked with DBS to conduct fund flow tracing, which led to the identification and freezing of all the accounts controlled by the scammer.'This enabled DBS and the police to prevent the loss of most of the transactions, although US$4m had already been transferred out of Singapore.Over the next few days, two separate cases were linked to the same syndicate allegedly behind this heist.The police said: 'In total, the amount recovered from this scam series was about US$11.5 million. The police are working closely with its stakeholders to recover the remaining money lost.'For its efforts, the DBS Anti-Scam Team received the SPF Community Partnership Award at a ceremony on Friday.Mr David Chew, director of the Commercial Affairs Department, said: 'The responsiveness and quick actions of the bank staff enabled the successful recovery of the foreign victims' money, even though the initial report was received on a weekend.' Other variations of the BEC scam include scammers impersonating the victims' supervisors and asking them to buy gift cards.The victims would realise they had fallen prey only when they clarified with their supplier or supervisor and realised they did not make any request or receive any payment.Communications and technology professor Lim Sun Sun from the Singapore University of Technology and Design recalled how a few years ago, a male colleague had received an e-mail purportedly sent by her, asking for help to buy a Google Play store top up card. She said: “Scammers make e-mails as brief as possible to give away fewer tell-tale signs while still conveying the need for a task to be completed. But my colleagues did not fall for the scam as they knew I would not typically write such a curt e-mail. “Scammers can easily find the organisational charts of these companies online and targeted middle and senior managers who clearly have people reporting to them and spoofed their e-mails.” Mr Andy Prakash, co-founder of cyber-security firm Privacy Ninja, noted how in such scams, recipients of these e-mails may not be able to spot any signs that the e-mail is spoofed, if they do not have phishing e-mail detection tools installed. He said: “Using a software, scammers can send a victim an e-mail from an address which looks identical to the sender they are impersonating and unless you know how to identify the original sender found inside the metadata of the e-mail, you will not be able to spot the difference.” The police reminded businesses to be mindful of any new or sudden changes in payment instructions. They should verify these instructions by calling the senders of such e-mails, using phone numbers they already have instead of those provided in the fraudulent e-mails.To prevent work e-mail accounts from being hacked, organisations can use strong passwords, change them regularly and enable two-factor authentication whenever possible.Businesses affected by such scams should call their bank immediately.Those with information related to such scams are advised to call the police hotline on 1800-255-0000 or submit it online at their website.For more information on scams, visit the Scam Alert website or call the anti-scam hotline on 1800-722-6688.",

            "Description": "SINGAPORE - Seniors do not always understand commonly used terms such as uniform resource locator (URL) and one-time password (OTP), and the lack of familiarity with such phrases discourages them from learning more about scams, said Mr James Loo, 73.The retired auditor, a volunteer with non-profit organisation RSVP Singapore, has observed this in his interactions with 160 seniors while conducting free talks to teach them about the dangers of scams.Mr Loo is one of more than 50 seniors who have been recruited since last November to serve as anti-scam advocates, as part of a joint initiative by Sengkang Neighbourhood Police Centre and RSVP Singapore.Speaking to reporters on Saturday (July 30), Mr Loo said: 'Seniors are very vulnerable - they are very much at a disadvantage because they are not tech savvy. As seniors, we can speak to them in a language they understand. Many of the seniors speak Chinese, but they cannot read these characters. And when you use acronyms, they will not be able to follow.'Mr Loo was among about 100 seniors who were present at the launch of Project Praise (Police-RSVP Anti-Scam Engagement) at Sengkang Community Club on Saturday.Minister of State for Home Affairs and Social and Family Development Sun Xueling, who attended the event, spoke about ongoing efforts by the authorities to detect scams, work with foreign counterparts to bust syndicates and to ramp up education efforts, especially for vulnerable groups such as seniors.Ms Sun said: 'Given that most senior citizens are not working and depend on their retirement savings, the losses hit them especially hard.'Earlier this week, the MP for Punggol West spoke to one of her residents who said her mother-in-law, 68, had lost her life savings in a China officials impersonation scam. The victim, who works as a cleaner, has not been sleeping well since the incident in May.Ms Sun said: 'She now relies on sleeping pills to be able to rest. Her family members are very worried about her. They are worried about her health (and) that she might not be able to find her strength to carry on.'With Project Praise, seniors will be able to turn to those in the same age group and are more likely to trust them because they have been through similar lived experiences and have a similar level of understanding of digital devices, she added.On Saturday, the seniors also watched videos re-enacting how scams take place, with subtitles in Chinese and were quizzed by representatives from the police and RSVP on warning signs. Mr Peter Tan, 70, a retired logistics driver, who was at the event, said he learnt how intricate scams such as the China officials impersonation scam can be.He said: 'There are so many people involved, who take your money and ask you for information, so you think they are real. But now I know as long as they ask for money, I must not give them anything.'Project Praise is the second anti-scam initiative launched by the police in the past two weeks.On July 23, Ang Mo Kio Police Division kick-started the Safe@Home programme, which aims to educate 268,000 households in Ang Mo Kio, Hougang, Punggol, Sengkang and Serangoon about the dangers of scams through house visits and the distribution of advisories.",

We encourage members to retain this SMS on their mobile phones so that (they) can be assured that any future SMSes received on this same sender ID would be legitimate,' it added.Any SMSes purporting to be sent by the CPF Board on any other sender ID should be ignored and deleted.In April, the board said an SMS sent to CPF members informing them that their ElderShield insurance policies have been terminated is legitimate, after netizens questioned its legitimacy on social media.The SMS had a clickable link directing people to a website about CareShield Life, which replaces ElderShield, with an instruction to log in with their Singpass for more details.'The message is meant to notify CPF members that they are enrolled in CareShield Life, and that their ElderShield policies are being terminated,' said the board then in response to queries.",

The police added that people should follow crime prevention measures such as not clicking on links provided in unsolicited e-mails and text messages, verifying the authenticity of the information with the official website or sources, and not disclosing personal or Internet banking details and OTP to anyone.People should also report any fraudulent credit or debit card charges to the respective banks and cancel their card immediately, the statement added.",

The police said that members of the public should never share their Singpass, bank account login details, and one-time password with anyone, including family and friends.They added that no government agency will instruct payment through a telephone call or other social messaging platforms, or ever ask for personal banking information such as i- banking passwords.The public were advised to always verify information with official websites and sources and if in doubt, call a trusted friend or talk to a relative before acting.The annual police crime statistics released in February showed that the number of China officials impersonation scams rose from 442 in 2020 to 752 in 2021.In 2021, the largest sum lost in a single case was $6.2 million.For more information on scams, people can visit scamalert.sg or call the Anti-Scam Hotline on 1800-722-6688.Anyone with information on scam activity may call the police on 1800-255-0000 or submit the information online at this website.",

            "Description": "SINGAPORE - More than $200 million has been recovered by the Anti-Scam Centre, with the police now targeting scammers even before people realise they have fallen prey and make a report.At the Police Workplan Seminar on Tuesday (April 26), it was revealed that as at last month, the Anti-Scam Centre has frozen more than 27,300 bank accounts and recovered more than $200 million since its inception in June 2019.But while fund recovery remains a key function, anti-scam operations will now focus on upstream interventions, dismantling scam operations before victims even realise they have fallen for a scam.Each of the seven police land divisions across Singapore now has its own Scam Strike Team comprising hand-picked officers who are experienced and specialise in fighting scams. This was revealed at Tuesday's seminar.The teams are dedicated units that target money mules and runners here, working closely with their colleagues and overseas counterparts to tackle and solve syndicated and transnational scam cases.The Anti-Scam Centre was set up as a specialised unit under the Commercial Affairs Department (CAD) in 2019.Last year, the Anti-Scam Division was formed, reorganising and consolidating all scam-fighting units under the CAD.The division was expanded last month to become the Anti-Scam Command, which brings together all scam-fighting units across the entire Singapore Police Force.The new command sees coordinated anti-scam operations boosted by technology that can detect and automatically alert potential scam victims even before they become prey to scammers.When victims make a police report, this will be scanned for online monikers, websites and advertisements linked to scam activities.These will then be taken down with the help of online marketplace platforms and telecommunication companies.In his speech at the Police Workplan Seminar, Minister for Home Affairs and Law K. Shanmugam said scams remain a key concern, with cases rising 52 per cent over the past year.'The police force is reorganising its resources to tackle new crime trends,' he said.'The Anti-Scam Command consolidates investigation of all types of scams into one unit, and oversees the newly formed Scam Strike Teams in the land divisions. That will help in better sense-making, more effective crime prevention and a faster response against scams.' Speaking to the media, the director of CAD, Mr David Chew, said the new command partners more than 60 institutions, including local and foreign banks, non-bank financial institutions, cryptocurrency houses and remittance service providers.Mr Chew introduced representatives from four such partners during a media session on the seminar.They were from Standard Chartered Bank, Singtel, cryptocurrency platform Coinhako and gaming firm Razer.Mr Chew said building close working relationships with such institutions was critical for the Anti-Scam Command to swiftly freeze accounts, recover funds and reduce losses suffered by victims.He said the command will continue to work with banks and fintech companies to develop systems that use artificial intelligence to identify and block suspicious transactions.Currently, only DBS Bank has an employee co-located at the Anti-Scam Centre in the Police Cantonment Complex.It was previously reported that both OCBC and UOB banks also have plans to have staff working from the centre.Mr Yap Jee Hoe, head of client diligence and fraud risk management at StanChart, said it is committed to fighting scams and it, too, will send an employee to the centre.'We remain strongly committed to protecting our customers, and to do so, we have to be part of this anti-scam ecosystem,' he said.'I do hear a lot of stories from scam victims, and it's quite painful. I feel for them.'He added that the partnership with the new command has proven fruitful.Mr Yap said that just last month, the partnership enabled them to help a bank customer recover close to $300,000 that was almost lost to scammers.'The victim was, of course, very grateful,' he said.'We hope other players will come on board to also partner the Anti-Scam Command and further raise awareness of scams so that everyone is protected.'",

            "Description": "SINGAPORE - Over the past four months, at least 154 victims have lost $7.1 million to tech support scams, the police said in a joint statement with the Cyber Security Agency of Singapore (CSA) on Tuesday (April 26).This scam, which is not new, involves scammers pretending to assist victims with computer or Wi-Fi network issues in order to gain access to their funds.One method saw victims receive a pop-up alert while using the Internet on their computers.The alert states that their computer has been compromised, with instructions to contact the software provider, such as Microsoft.'The number usually appears as variants of +653159(XXXX), leading victims to believe that it is a valid local help desk contact number,' said the police and CSA.Victims who called the number spoke to scammers who impersonated tech support personnel.The second method saw victims receive unsolicited calls from scammers who claimed to be working for Internet service providers such as Singtel.The scammers would tell the victims that their Wi-Fi network has been compromised by hackers and were calling to assist with the issue.In some instances, the scammers claimed there were fraudulent transactions made from the victim's bank account and that government officers were investigating the issue.To make their claims seem legitimate, the fraudsters sent fake verification emails from spoofed accounts such as 'investigation@csa.gov.sg' to the victims.In both methods, scammers told victims to download a remote access application, such as TeamViewer, UltraViewer or AnyDesk, which gave the scammers control of the victims' devices.'Under the pretext of resolving the issue, the scammers would instruct victims to log into their Internet banking account and provide their credit or debit card details, as well as one-time password,' the authorities said.Using remote access, the scammers would then transfer funds from the victim's bank accounts or make fraudulent charges to the bank cards.The police and CSA also highlighted a third method used by scammers where victims were directed to scan a Singpass QR code on a phishing website. Scammers claimed that this was part of the verification process.When victims did so, scammers could create cryptocurrency wallets with their details, which could be used to facilitate the flow of illicit proceeds. The authorities clarified that no telecommunications service provider or government agency would request an individual's personal details, access to their online bank account over the phone or through automated voice machines, or ask for payment for services rendered.Should anyone fall for a scam, they should uninstall any software that was downloaded under the scammer's instructions and then turn off the device to limit the scammer's illicit activities.Apart from changing their Internet banking credentials and removing any unauthorised payees that may have been added to their bank accounts, victims should also inform their banks and the police of the incident.To avoid getting scammed, the authorities reminded people to ignore calls with the '+' sign prefix as it indicates that it is an international incoming call or spoofed call.They added that when logging into a digital service using the Singpass app, it is important to ensure that the domain URL displayed on the Singpass app's consent page matches that on the browser before proceeding.'If not, do not tap on the 'Log in' button on the consent screen,' the authorities said.Members of the public who wish to provide information related to scams can call the police hotline on 1800-255-0000 or submit it online.",

            "Description": "SINGAPORE - A new phone scam has surfaced where scammers impersonate officers from the Intellectual Property Office of Singapore (Ipos), said the police on Tuesday (April 12).In a statement, the police said that they have received reports from the public of scammers approaching victims via calls purporting to be from the Ipos hotline number, 6339-8616.The police added that no losses have been reported yet.This comes one day after a similar scam where victims received unsolicited phone calls from individuals claiming to be bank employees and were told that their bank accounts had been misused and that they were under investigation for money laundering.The phone numbers of these calls often contain a +65 prefix, suggesting that the calls were made from overseas.In the latest scams, victims reported receiving unsolicited phone calls from a caller claiming to be an Ipos officer.The caller would tell the victim he was under investigation for offences involving trademark or copyright infringement.Victims who denied the allegations would then be told that their details had been misused and that they had to report the matter to the authorities.The call would then be transferred to another person claiming to be in law enforcement, to whom the victims had to file a report.The victims would be asked to provide their personal information such as passport details, home address and social media account login.In another case, victims were instructed to go to Ipos' office, and if they could not do so, they were to provide their personal details to facilitate investigations.These victims would realise they had been scammed only after calling Ipos' official hotline to find out more about the 'investigations'.Ipos has advised members of the public to take the following precautions:Ignore such calls and the caller's instructions. Ipos does not ask for personal details, inform a member of the public about infringement cases, direct him to make a payment nor contact him about any overseas IP filing over the phone, SMS or e-mail;Never disclose personal particulars to anyone, including family and friends;When in doubt, contact Ipos directly at ipos_enquiry@ipos.gov.sg or on 6339-8616.Members of the public who have information related to such crimes should call the police hotline on 1800-255-0000, or submit it online.For more information on scams, visit this website or call the Anti-Scam Hotline on 1800-722-6688.",

            "Description": "SINGAPORE - A 29-year-old man was arrested by the police for his suspected involvement in Ponzi-like job scams that promised commissions earned merely by viewing movie trailers, in an islandwide anti-scam enforcement operation conducted on April 1 and 5.In a statement on Wednesday (April 6), the police said they received information on March 30 about an emerging job scam platform, Moviitech, that lured job seekers through unsolicited messages on Telegram, Facebook, Instagram, YouTube and elsewhere that promised lucrative and easy money-making opportunities.Job seekers were required to register for a free account and purchase a membership plan ranging from $65 to $450, before they could start earning commissions by watching movie trailers on the platform. They would also be able to increase their earnings by recruiting more people to participate on the platform.The top-up and withdrawal transactions were done through bank transfers.Users would be convinced that it was a legitimate job as they would receive commissions and profit during the early stages of their memberships. They would realise they had been scammed only when they did not receive further commissions or were unable to withdraw from their member accounts.The police added that the Commercial Affairs Department had also identified another three men aged between 18 and 41 during the operations who are assisting with investigations for their suspected involvement in the scams.Preliminary investigations revealed that the bogus company allegedly ran the Ponzi-like schemes using multi-level marketing strategies. The four men facilitated the schemes by advertising and recruiting job seekers as members and providing bank accounts to facilitate the movement of illegal funds.Police investigations are ongoing.Guilty individuals can draw jail sentences of up to 20 years, fines, or both, for committing this kind of fraud. For helping to commit it, the punishment is jail of up to 10 years and fines.The police said that job seekers should be wary of online job advertisements that promise the convenience of working from home and a high salary for relatively simple job responsibilities.They added that legitimate businesses would not require job seekers to make upfront payments to secure job offers and earn commissions.'To avoid becoming involved in money-laundering activities, members of the public should always reject requests to use their personal bank or cryptocurrency accounts to receive and transfer money for others,' they said.",

            "Description": "SINGAPORE - When a housewife in her 50s demanded to close insurance policies worth some $200,000 in October last year, OCBC Bank staff who attended to her suspected that she was involved in a scam.This is because it did not make financial sense to prematurely dissolve the insurance policies, said Jurong Point OCBC branch manager Leong Wen Xian, 34, who investigated the claim.The woman's bank transactions revealed that she had already transferred up to $40,000 of her life savings to suspicious overseas accounts. She later revealed that the accounts belonged to users who claimed to be 'officials from China'.They told her she was being probed for spreading fake claims about Covid-19 and warned her not to tell anyone about the investigation. She was ordered to hand over her banking and personal details, Mr Leong recalled.He said: 'The woman was in disbelief when she found out that this was a lie. She tried to hide (her situation) from the bank staff and spoke so confidently about making this transaction, unlike normal scam victims who show up looking nervous.'Our customers are often normal people who have worked many years to save for their livelihoods. This would have been a huge loss.'Mr Leong and his colleague, Ms Sara Lee, who was also involved in this case, were among 120 individuals and companies awarded by the police for thwarting scams.The Community Partnership Award (CPA) ceremony was held at the police headquarters at New Phoenix Park on Thursday (April 7).Some of the awardees had collectively prevented $14 million from being lost to scams in more than 40 cases between 2021 and February this year, while others played a part by running campaigns to educate the public on the latest scam trends.Separately, DBS Bank was given an award for working with the police to freeze 5,300 bank accounts linked to scams and recover around $35 million of scam money last year. It is understood that most of the cases were linked to investment, loan and job scams and that the money will be returned to victims after investigations are complete.Mr Elvin Lim, DBS' group head of investigations, said the bank will deploy more staff to the Anti-Scam Centre at the Police Cantonment Complex by June to aid with scam investigations under a partnership that began 2019.It is understood that other banks will soon follow to deploy officers permanently at the centre to speed up investigations into fraud.The amount recovered by DBS is roughly a third of the $103 million of scam money recovered in 2021, the police said.The police added that they recovered $31.5 million of swindled money in January and February this year. During the ceremony, Minister of State for Home Affairs Desmond Tan, who presented the awards, announced new guidelines on online safety, which can be downloaded from the Asia Internet Coalition website.The guidelines aim to arm businesses and users with frameworks to prevent scams and provide the public with an overview of scam trends.Victims lost more than $600 million last year in some 24,000 reported scam cases, said Mr Tan in his address.He said Singapore is an attractive target for online scammers due to its high Internet connectivity and added that the best defence against fraud is a discerning public. He cited how Hougang MRT Station UOB branch manager Joshua Wee, who also won the CPA, stopped a 77-year-old customer from transferring some $80,000 to scammers in February.Mr Wee shared in an interview with the media that the man, who is married, fell in love with a fraudster with whom he communicated through text frequently for six months.Although they had never met in person, the man agreed to transfer US$60,000 (S$81,600) to a purported logistics company when the woman asked him for help to get a precious parcel that she claimed was stuck in transit released, Mr Wee, 55, recounted.He said: 'The man is very articulate and looked like he knew what he was doing, but thankfully he was stopped.'Mr Wee, a branch manager for seven years, added: 'The woman had built trust with this man over half a year and preyed on his emotions. The scammers are patient enough to build this friendship with the man - that is how scary scams are.'",

            "Description": "SINGAPORE - Many scam victims think getting their lost money back is a simple process and assume banks or the police can block their accounts and reverse any transaction once they lodge a report.But in reality, it may take several hours just to have an account frozen, and requires cooperation from multiple stakeholders to help just one victim, said the officers and staff at the police's Anti-Scam Centre (ASC).And even then, success is never guaranteed, they added.Scam victims here lost at least $633.3 million last year.The police had frozen more than 12,600 bank accounts and were able to recover more than $102 million that was lost to scams.The ASC said when someone calls the anti-scam hotline (1800-722-6688) managed by the National Crime Prevention Council (NCPC), someone like Mr Nicholas Soong, 29, answers.The NCPC anti-scam hotline officer said victims are usually flustered, angry and can be quite aggressive.Said Mr Soong: 'They are anxious and impatient, and not so willing to explain their situation, but instead demand we find them immediate solutions.'We explain to them if they aren't calm, the information they give us may not be accurate, and such information is critical in aiding police investigations.'The NCPC is a non-profit organisation, but works closely with the Singapore Police Force and the ASC. In 2020, its officers handled more than 9,100 hotline calls.Officers like Mr Soong are tasked with not just speaking to victims who call in, but also filtering and flagging urgent cases to the police at the ASC for immediate action.But there are other complications.Assistant Superintendent of Police (ASP) Geraldine Cheng, 32, an officer-in-charge at the centre, said victims often feel overwhelmed. In some instances, if their case was flagged by a family member or friend, the victims may not believe they have been scammed.'Victims are often already groomed and brainwashed by scammers prior to the engagement,' she said.She added many victims also have their own psychological biases, refusing to believe they would ever fall for a scam and are blinded by shame and embarrassment.Officers will meet victims physically if they are unable to convince them over the phone.Sometimes, victims not only lose their own money, but find themselves unwittingly used as money or document mules for the scammers.In January, three foreign students were jailed for between seven and 18 months after they became involved with a transnational money mule syndicate.Laws will be amended in the fourth quarter of this year to allow for more money mules with lower culpability to be prosecuted.ASP Cheng explained while it takes a scammer just seconds to make transactions to numerous accounts, officers have to comb through dozens - sometimes hundreds of such transactions - carefully, taking significantly more time.She said: 'The scammers intentionally complicate the fund flows by layering with multiple conduits within a matter of seconds and sometimes across multiple countries.'ASP Teo Ming Kai, 33, a senior investigation officer with the centre, said freezing a bank account is also not straightforward.He said: 'The bank accounts fall under the custody of the respective banks, and so the police do not have immediate access to these accounts.'The police have to first accurately identify the relevant bank accounts, and work with the banks to freeze them, he added.The length of this process varies depending on the case, and details of exactly how this is done cannot be revealed publicly because of operational sensitivities. ASP Teo said because the police will always have to go through the banks, having bank staff located in the ASC was important.Mr Yaznisham Yazid, 29, a member of the DBS Bank anti-scam team inside the ASC, said being there allows the freezing of compromised DBS bank accounts to be done quickly, and vital information can be shared directly with officers there.He added: 'This is a very time-sensitive process, hence we have a dedicated fraud team on standby 24/7.'There are still limits to what the banks can do, such as when the money is transferred out of Singapore.He said: 'Typically, once the funds are transferred overseas by scammers, the chances of recovery are very low.'The fight against scams is a shared responsibility. All of us, including banks, telcos, SMS aggregators and customers, need to do our part.'The scam reporting process:- Immediately notify your bank and lodge a police report online via this website, or at any neighbourhood police centre. You can also call the anti-scam hotline on 1800-722-6688.- Officers will ask for more details to better identify the type of scam encountered and lodge the report accordingly.- Victims may be asked how they became acquainted with the scammers, and for transaction details such as amounts transferred, date and time of the transactions, beneficiary accounts and how the transaction was made.- An investigation officer will be assigned to the case and the Anti-Scam Centre will be notified immediately.- The centre will work with stakeholders like banks to trace and attempt to recover funds for victims.- This often involves the police asking the bank to freeze the relevant accounts.- The banks will also try to furnish other details to the police.- Victims will be updated when there are significant developments regarding their case.",

            "Description": "SINGAPORE - Since last Monday (March 14), property agent Alan Wee, 42, has been receiving two to three calls every day inquiring about a three-bedroom unit in Tampines.But Mr Wee, who specialises in marketing resale properties, does not have any such listing.After talking to the callers, Mr Wee realised that he was a victim of impersonation, with scammers using his name and profile picture to ask for a deposit from potential buyers to view the unit.Mr Wee, an ERA Realty agent, said: 'The people calling me were anxious as they wanted to know whether they had secured a viewing. I think they must have found my number from websites.'If you look at the listing, it claims the unit is 140 sq ft. That is the size of a bedroom, not a three-bedroom unit. It is a scam.'On Tuesday (March 22), the police confirmed a report was lodged.  They had warned on Monday of a scam in which criminals pretend to be property agents and ask victims to pay money to secure an appointment for a viewing.Victims would then be provided with bank account numbers and phone numbers to transfer the sum. They would realise they have been tricked after the scammers stop contacting them.The Straits Times understands that at least two property agencies - ERA Realty and Huttons Group - have seen their agents impersonated.Since January this year, at least 144 people have fallen victim to this scam with losses amounting to $190,000.Speaking to ST on Monday evening, Mr Wee said he reported a fake listing of the Tampines unit that was posted on Carousell. Carousell said that the seller's account has been suspended based on data suggesting possible impersonation.Property experts said that such scams could be making a comeback with Build-To-Order housing projects delayed and condominium and HDB rents on the rise.Mr Nicholas Mak, ERA Realty head of research and consultancy, said: 'Scammers target those who are less experienced in the property market, such as newly arrived foreigners or younger tenants desperate to secure a home.'There is no such practice in the market where the customer needs to give a deposit just to view a property.' Dr Lee Nai Jia, deputy director of National University of Singapore's Institute of Real Estate and Urban Studies, warned that as a result of these scams, property listing sites could suffer reputational losses.He said: 'Some agents still rely on cold calls to find new clients. But if potential buyers become more wary, they may request for face-to-face meetups, which are not so easy to organise during Covid-19 with safe distancing measures.'If potential buyers find many fake listings on a property website, they may also move on to other portals.'Although the Carousell listing has been removed, the scammers impersonating him are still active on WhatsApp according to checks by ST.Mr Wee said: 'It is frustrating. This affects my reputation. When we sell houses, people hand over their most important asset to us to market because they trust us.'I hope this doesn't happen to other agents.' How to protect yourself from property scams1. View property listings from reputable and established portals.2. Search for the property agent and his official mobile number on the Council for Estate Agencies' (CEA) public register. If the search does not lead to a property agent's profile page, it means that the phone number is not registered with CEA and could be an indication that the listing is fake.3. Never sign a tenancy agreement or pay a rental deposit without physically viewing the property and meeting the agent.4. Property agents are not authorised to handle cash transactions. Make payments through verifiable means such as crossed cheques or bank transfers directly to the landlord.5. Beware of suspicious property listings. Check the dimensions, location, photos and reviews.Sources: Council for Estate Agencies, ERA Realty, Singapore Police Force",

            "Description": "SINGAPORE - A new scam variant has emerged, targeting logistics and moving companies, the police said on Thursday (March 24).In March, at least 10 victims fell prey to such scammers, with losses amounting to at least $9,000, the police added in a statement.Pretending to be a tenant in a building or mall, the scammers would contact such companies on messaging applications such as WhatsApp to engage their moving services, offering to pay in cash.Based on screenshots provided by the police, the 'items' being moved could include cabinets or office machines to be disposed of.Once the two parties strike a deal, the scammers would provide the logistics firm with a contact number for the building management so it can obtain approval to carry out the service.Unknown to the victim, the 'building management' is part of the scam. When the victim contacts the number provided on WhatsApp, a scammer - posing as a building management staff member - would instruct the victim to pay a refundable deposit to facilitate the approval process for the moving service.The victims, who are told to deposit the money into bank accounts belonging to unknown individuals, would realise they have been scammed only when both the 'client' and 'building management' become uncontactable after the deposit has been paid.The police reminded logistics and moving companies to verify that a client is indeed a tenant in the building. They can check with the building's management through official contact details provided on its website.They are also reminded not to transfer money to accounts belonging to unknown individuals without verification.Those who wish to provide information related to such scams can call the police hotline on 1800-255-0000 or submit it online at this website.For scam-related advice, they can call 1800-722-6688 or visit this website.",

The fake website has also been blocked, said GovTech.It added: 'We urge all Singpass users to remain vigilant when transacting online (and to) always check the website domain when accessing a service.'Noting that Singpass does not send SMSes with hyperlinks, GovTech reminded users to avoid clicking on unverified links from unknown senders.GovTech said: 'If you are unsure of the legitimacy of a message, verify directly with the official agency and organisation.'In February, the police warned about another scam involving Singpass. Scammers would create fake surveys purportedly conducted on behalf of reputable companies.They would ask the victims to scan a Singpass QR code with their Singpass app. Victims were told they needed to do so to retrieve their survey results so that a reward could be paid out.However, the Singpass QR code was a screenshot taken from a legitimate website, and by scanning the QR code and authorising the transactions without further checks, victims could give scammers access to online services.Those who suspect they have fallen victim to phishing sites can take these steps immediately: Reset your Singpass password at this website, and check your Singpass transaction history for any suspicious activities.Those who encounter such scams can call the Anti-Scam Hotline on 1800-722-6688. They can also call the Singpass helpline on 6335-3533.",

            "Description": "SINGAPORE - Scammers have diversified to include using QR codes to dupe victims, with the police warning of two new scams involving the barcode.Sengkang Neighbourhood Police Centre (NPC) on Wednesday (Feb 23) warned of a scam involving a printed flier of a Grab food voucher giveaway and a QR code. The QR code leads to a request for personal details.Grab clarified that it did not create the flier and does not have promotions that require users to scan a QR code to redeem vouchers, said the NPC.This comes after the police said on Tuesday that a Singpass QR code scam has surfaced in which victims are asked to fill out surveys in exchange for a monetary reward.The scammers would send victims a Singpass QR code claiming that the victims had to verify their identity and accept the rewards, but the QR code is, in fact, a screenshot of a legitimate online service seeking authentification.Many websites, including those of government agencies, telecoms companies, insurance firms and banks authenticate their services using Singpass.By scanning the QR code and authorising the transaction, victims would be tricked into giving the scammers access to these online services.Observers The Straits Times spoke to said QR code scanning on its own is safe when transactions on websites and cashier counters are initiated by the user, but they urged the public to exercise caution and not to scan a QR code sent by an unknown person on a messaging platform.Mr Amos Tan, assistant director of Singapore Polytechnic's School of Business, told ST that customers might develop a fear of making online transactions, but this should not affect the sales of merchants as they can pivot to other payment methods.'Scammers tend to move from one form of payment or method of collecting personal data to others once the method has been widely reported on and people know to look out for them... I don't believe sales will be affected but the method of transactions might be, in terms of where they take place,' he said.Mr Tan added that businesses could offer customers who are fearful of paying online the option of transacting in person.They could also alert clients to phishing scams and send out messages to remind them that the company would not ask for personal details over the phone, he said.Payment platforms that ST contacted urged users of the QR code function to check the beneficiary or merchant details and the transacted amount before authorising payment.Mr Keith Chen, general manager of payment app Fave, said it was a shame that scammers are using a convenient tool to trick consumers. He advised Fave users to scan QR codes using the Fave app only at physical stores with cashiers or online websites of Fave's merchants.'We highly recommend that customers do not engage with QR codes that are shared via chat platforms from unauthorised or unknown contact,' said Mr Chen.Similarly, a spokesman for Grab said the company would never send users QR codes via SMS or messaging platforms.The spokesman urged users to look out for signs of a potential phishing scam, such as an urgent call to action, the promise of attractive rewards, and suspicious links or attachments, including QR codes from unexpected or first-time senders.Grab uses artificial intelligence, machine learning and experts to analyse and detect fraudulent or scam content to take down fake postings or illegal content, the spokesman added.Grab users can call the company's fraud helpline on 6902-1036 if they are unsure about a message they have received. How to avoid falling prey to Singpass QR code scamNever scan a Singpass QR code sent by someone else, say the police. Scan the Singpass QR code on only the official website of the e-service that you want to access, or tap on Singpass QR codes on the official apps of these e-services.Always verify with official sources whether the information you have received is sent by the organisation and if authentication using the Singpass app is necessary.After scanning a Singpass QR code, always check the consent screen on the Singpass app to verify the digital service. Ensure that the domain URL displayed on the Singpass app matches that in the browser address bar.Never disclose your Singpass ID, password and two-factor authentication (2FA) details to others.Suspicious activities can be reported to the Singpass helpdesk by calling 6335-3533.Those with any information relating to such crimes can call the police hotline on 1800-255-0000, or go to the police's I-Witness website.If urgent police assistance is required, call 999.",

            "Description": "SINGAPORE - Victims in Singapore have lost more money to investment scams than any other ruse in the last three years.It hit a record high last year, with $190.9 million stolen in such scams, more than five times the $36.9 million lost in 2019.A recent variant that has appeared here is the pig-butchering scam.Fraudsters spend months cultivating a relationship with the victims before urging them to invest in bogus investment schemes.According to news reports, pig-butchering scams started in China in 2016. Back then, scammers groomed their victims to place bets on fake gambling websites.The Chinese term 'sha zhu pan' - it means to fatten a pig before slaughtering it - was coined by the perpetrators themselves to describe their scam.The Chinese government cracked down on illegal betting in 2018. But fraudsters then targeted Chinese speakers in South-east Asia.As the demographic expanded to include Europe and the United States, scam tactics evolved to keep abreast with the growing popularity of cryptocurrency investments.In response to queries, the Singapore Police Force said victims here ended up transferring money to banks predominantly in China, including Hong Kong.'They were asked to pay administrative fees, security fees or taxes in order to reap profits. In many cases, victims earned a profit in the initial stage, leading them to believe that the investment is legitimate and lucrative,' the police told The Sunday Times.'Once larger amounts of monies were deposited into the designated accounts, the scammers became uncontactable.'There is no official data on the number of pig-butchering scams busted in Singapore each year.According to the Global Anti-Scam Organisation, a volunteer-driven advocacy group which includes Singaporean members, most victims of pig-butchering scams had emptied their savings account and many even ended up in debt. Losses average US$134,940 ($182,000) per person, based on over 400 victims surveyed by the organisation from North America, Europe, Taiwan and South-east Asia.About 70 per cent were women aged between 25 and 40 years old.Victims were predominantly highly educated - nearly 90 per cent held a bachelor's degree or higher.To combat investment scams, the Singapore authorities uses technology to identify and warn potential victims by sending them targeted SMS advisories.The police said they also work with foreign law enforcement agencies on joint operations to cripple syndicates.",

            "Description": "SINGAPORE - Some Instagram users have received messages supposedly from their followers that promise gifts that they can redeem by keying in their password in a separate login page that looks deceptively like an Instagram page.But simply tapping on these links appears to be enough for hackers to gain access to users' accounts - even without entering one's password.In cases seen by The Straits Times, users first receive a message from a follower with a compromised account claiming he has a gift for them. The message usually says: 'This took a few hours to make. I hope you love it.'The contents of these gifts are never specified.The message comes with a personalised link directing them to a separate website that includes the receivers' username, tricking them into believing the link was crafted especially for them.Shortly after, swindlers gain access to the user's account and use it to broadcast a similar scam message to other followers, who in turn may be deceived into thinking their friends are offering them a gift.A similar line of Instagram scams was reported in overseas media, including British newspaper The Independent, which warned that the login page is a sham that allows hackers to enter users' accounts.It reported: 'There (are) no gifts - and instead, that page will simply steal a user's password, with affected people reporting that they are simply thrown onto an online gambling page at the end.'Hackers will then have access to a user's password, allowing them to send the same message to other users, The Independent wrote. It said that the first thing users should do is change their password.Users should take caution before entering passwords on any website, it added.Responding to queries from The Straits Times, a spokesman for Meta, which runs Instagram, urged users to pick strong, unique passwords and never share them with people they do not trust.The spokesman added that users should turn on two-factor authentication in their settings for added security, but did not provide further details on the scam.She pointed to an advisory under Meta that warns users not to trust messages that offer gifts, demand for money or threaten to delete their account, and to promptly report such cases to Instagram or Facebook, which Meta also operates.",

            "Description": "SINGAPORE: Crime levels in Singapore rose in 2021 with reported cases up nearly 24 per cent from the year before, fuelled by a large spike in scam cases, said the police on Wednesday (Feb 16).Of the 46,196 reported cases in 2021, more than half – or 23,931 cases – involved scams, increasing from the year before when scams made up about 40 per cent of all cases.These figures from 2021 also marked a 53 per cent surge from 15,651 scam cases the year before.“Scammers have been constantly evolving their tactics and taking advantage of the COVID-19 situation to prey on the public’s increase in online activities, and also their heightened sense of vulnerability and uncertainty,” said the police.As a result, Singapore’s overall crime rates also rose to 847 cases per 100,000 people in 2021, up from 656 cases per 100,000 people in 2020.JOB SCAMS MOST COMMONJob scams were the most common scam type with 4,554 reported cases last year, skyrocketing from only 132 reported cases in 2020.The amounts cheated soared to at least S$91 million in 2021, up from at least S$217,000 the year before.Police noted four main variants of job scams, with one example requiring victims to download fake mobile applications to grab the job and then top up funds into their account.After being promised commission for completing tasks, their account would also reflect some sums, but victims would then be unable to withdraw the money.Alongside job scams, non-banking related phishing scams, e-commerce scams, investment scams, loan scams and banking related phishing scams also “remain of particular concern”, said the police.The total number of reported cases for these top six scam types nearly doubled compared to 2020.Overall, the total amount cheated for the top ten scam types rose to S$504.4 million last year, from S$175.2 million the year before. Top ten scam types in Singapore in 2021 Cases reported  2021Change from 2020Job Scams4,554+ 4,422Non-banking related phishing scams2,783+ 2,139E-commerce scams2,707- 652Investment scams2,476+ 1,380Loan scams2,274+ 296Banking related phishing scams2,237+ 897Social media impersonation scams1,614- 1,305Internet love scams1,099+ 276China officials impersonation scams752+ 310Fake friend call scams685+ 685 NON-BANKING RELATED PHISHING SCAMS, E-COMMERCE SCAMSNon-banking related phishing scams increased more than four-fold to 2,783 cases in 2021. Victims were cheated of at least S$15.3 million in 2021, a jump from at least S$984,000 in 2020.In most of these cases, culprits got victims to hand over their banking credentials, card details or one-time passwords (OTPs) using reasons such as checks on a parcel’s delivery status or a refund for unauthorised transactions, said the police.As for e-commerce scams, the number of reported cases fell by about 20 per cent to 2,707 cases in 2021, with the amount cheated also decreasing to at least S$5.8 million. INVESTMENT, LOAN, BANKING RELATED PHISHING SCAMSIn terms of amounts cheated, investment scams were the costliest in 2021, with victims losing S$190.9 million.The number of investment scams also more than doubled in 2021 to 2,476 scams, up from 1,096 cases in 2020.As for loan scams, cases increased by 15 per cent to 2,274 cases in 2021, while amount cheated rose to at least S$18.3 million.For banking related phishing scams, cases swelled by about 67 per cent to 2,237 in 2021, while the amount lost tripled to at least S$19.4 million.CYBER EXTORTION CASES “A CONCERN”Cyber extortion cases, where perpetrators typically coax victims into performing compromising acts in front of a camera and then extort them for money or credits, also increased.There were 420 such cases in 2021, up from 245 the year before. Victims lost at least S$1.3 million.The most common social media platforms where these cases took place were Facebook, Instagram and Tinder. DECREASE IN PHYSICAL CRIMEBut 2021 saw a decline in physical crimes, said the police.In particular, two types of crime classes fell to a 37-year-low. Housebreaking and related crimes fell by about 24 per cent to 160 cases, while theft and related crimes declined by 8 per cent to 6,843 cases.Police said this was largely due to “continuous crime prevention efforts, police presence on the ground and the use of technology to deter crime”.RISE IN VOYEURISM CASESThere were 467 voyeurism cases in 2021, nearly 20 per cent more than the 394 cases in 2020.Police noted there were fewer recorded cases in 2020 “likely because of the lower ridership on public transport, lower footfall at shopping malls, and the closure of public entertainment outlets during the Circuit Breaker”.About two-thirds of all voyeurism cases happened in residential premises (179 reported cases), within the public transport system (79 reported cases) and in shopping complexes (57 reported cases) in 2021.MORE CASES INVOLVING OUTRAGE OF MODESTYAs for cases involving an outrage of modesty, figures rose 12 per cent to hit 1,480 in 2021. Police said this increase was partly due to fewer cases having been recorded in 2020 due to the Circuit Breaker period.Overall, outrage of modesty cases accounted for more than 42 per cent of all sexual crime cases reported in 2021, they added.The police also noted that the number of these cases taking place within the public transport system “remains a concern”. In 2021, there were 148 such cases in this setting involving culprits unknown to the victim.EFFORTS TO FIGHT SCAMSWith scams significantly contributing to overall crime in 2021, the police said they have stepped up enforcement against these operations.“In 2021, the police conducted 26 islandwide anti-scam enforcement operations, leading to the investigation of more than 7,500 money mules and scammers,” they said.In addition, the police’s Anti-Scam Centre received more than 23,800 reports with losses amounting to S$520 million in 2021. But it recovered more than S$102 million and froze more than 12,600 bank accounts.Using technology, the centre was also able to detect and alert potential victims before they fell prey to the scam, resulting in more than 6,900 “successful interventions” between May and December last year. Going beyond Singapore’s borders, the police said they worked with foreign counterparts such as Interpol and the Hong Kong Police Force to conduct joint operations against transnational scams.In doing so, the police said they took down 16 scam syndicates in 2021 - comprising “nine job scam syndicates, four China/Government Officials impersonation scam syndicates and three internet love scam syndicates”. This led to the arrest of more than 230 people who were responsible for more than 1,350 cases.NEW E-COMMERCE TRANSACTION SAFETY RATINGSAs e-commerce scams are still one of the top scam types, the Inter-Ministry Committee on Scams will introduce E-commerce Marketplace Transaction Safety Ratings later this year.“They will provide an indication of the extent to which different e-commerce marketplaces have in place anti-scam measures that the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) assesses to be most critical in combating e-commerce scams,” said the police.This will allow consumers to decide which marketplace to use, based on the availability of safety features, added the police.PUBLIC VIGILANCE ESSENTIAL IN FIGHTING SCAMSThe police noted that at least 90 per cent of scams in Singapore originate from overseas, and these scammers “are syndicated, well-resourced and technologically sophisticated”.“Such cases are difficult to investigate and prosecute, as our efforts will be dependent on the level of cooperation from overseas law enforcement agencies, and their ability to track down the scammers operating in their jurisdiction.“Where monies have already been moved outside Singapore, recovery is very difficult.”Given the rate at which new scam types are emerging, a discerning and well-informed public is the best defence, said the police.They added they continue to work with the National Crime Prevention Council and other stakeholders on public education, focusing their efforts online – where most scams are taking place."

            "Description": "SINGAPORE - Picture this - a man wearing a jacket bearing the name of your bank turns up at your door, declares there is a problem with your account and asks you to hand over your details so he can fix the issue.And all without showing a bank identification card or even seeming to know your name.Pretty much everyone would spot this as a scam and laugh at the notion of handing over important bank details to a guy with 'crook' written all over his face.Even the idea that a bank would send an employee door to door to ask for customers' details is preposterous in itself. The reality is no bank would ever approach customers and ask for banking details outside of a branch.This applies even to online banking.Remember those times you call the bank for assistance? They ask for personal details only to verify your identity; the staff do not ask for your account details because a real bank knows everything about you. Only scammers want such information because they don't know who you are and what accounts you hold.Most people would not hand over bank details to strangers who show up at their doors even if they wear a shirt with the bank's name.But how come such vigilance disappears when you receive an SMS or e-mail asking you to hand over your banking details by logging into a site? And instead of wearing a bank's name on their shirts, online scammers spoof the bank's name via electronic messages to say your account has a problem and that you must key in your account details by clicking on the attached link.The message still does not identify you by your name or IC number, and if you pause to think for a moment, why would a bank ask you to log into your account to verify a banking problem when it could resolve such issues at its end?Yet scores of bank customers have fallen victim to such phishing scams, which lure them to part with critical data by setting up fake bank sites. In the latest phishing scam involving OCBC bank customers, 790 of them lost a total of $13.7 million to the crooks.Such scam tactics have been around for years, so it is worrying that many of the recent victims were young and tech-savvy; some even worked in tech-related jobs.Cyber-security and corporate governance expert Anthony Lim, who is a fellow at the Singapore University of Social Sciences, believes that the pervasive use of social media and online services has made many people impatient - they yearn for instant results because they are used to getting answers with a tap of their phones.'It is common knowledge that no bank will ask its customers to log into their accounts via SMS or e-mails whatever the circumstances and yet many people continue to do so. Scammers are counting on their behaviour of always clicking on links without checking and they have succeeded yet again.'It is time for all of us to take a step back and pause... if there appears to be a problem.'Mr Lim notes that scammers always use 'fear tactics' to push their victims into doing their bidding. Some of these ruses include claims that their accounts have been hacked, their relatives were hurt or kidnapped, and more recently, being in contact with Covid-19 patients. He says people can avoid being ripped off if they take the time to make their own checks instead of following the instructions that come with such calls and messages.Here are four good practices that can prevent you from being the next scam victim.1. Always be on the alert when you are onlineThe authorities and the banks have stepped up various measures that can make it harder for scammers to siphon money from a victim's account. These include lowering the default fund transfer amounts as well as delaying the process of putting the changes to accounts, such as adding a new payee, into effect.But all these efforts will come to nought if you still respond to unsolicited messages and calls and then disclose your account details. This is akin to allowing thieves to enter your home and hoping that someone will stop them before they escape.Note that if a bank's database is truly compromised, it will usually make a public announcement and then take remedial steps to solve the problem. In short, if you didn't do anything that put your own account at risk, you have nothing to worry about.Some people wonder why it is hard to recover the stolen money. After all Hollywood movies suggest that all bank transfers leave a digital trail that allows the cops to track down the criminals.The reality is that once money is transferred overseas, it is hard to even locate the owners of the recipient accounts as they could just be money mules who allow their accounts to be used and they know nothing about the real masterminds. 2. Have only one online banking practiceEveryone who uses digital banking should do this - always do your banking transactions the same way and never deviate from this practice.This means bank online only through the official bank apps on your phone or from your personal computer that is well-protected from spyware, and log into the genuine website by keying in the URL yourself, instead of googling for the bank websites.This is because scammers are known to use online ads to push their fake sites to unsuspecting users.Even if you feel compelled to log in to check after receiving a message that says your account is compromised, do so in your usual way and not by clicking any links in the message. And never use a stranger's device or do important transactions in public places because your keystrokes and inputs can be recorded easily, either by embedded software or hidden cameras.3. Save important hotlines on your phoneWhen you plan for retirement, you start now and not wait when you are retired. Similarly, when you are planning for financial security, you do it now and not wait for troubles to hit you.Start by saving all the relevant hotlines on your phone so that you can call instantly without having to search for the numbers online. Again, it is not wise to search for important information only when you need it because you can also end up with outdated, or worse, decoy links. 4. Don't keep big sums in your savings accountSome of the recent OCBC Bank victims had up to a few hundred thousand dollars in savings accounts that were wiped clean by the scammers.This begs the question: Why keep so much money in a savings account because even from a financial planning perspective, this is not prudent given that you earn a pittance in interest every month.Even if you prefer to hold cash and not invest it, put the portion that you are unlikely to use in the near future in a fixed deposit with a different bank.Doing so will allow you to enjoy a higher rate because it is 'fresh funds' to the new bank and if you do not have online banking with this bank, no one else can touch your money.You can open a fixed deposit with the same bank but if a scammer gains access to your online account, you should know that fixed deposits can also be withdrawn online.Yes, it is more troublesome to open a fixed deposit with another bank but the incentive for doing so is peace of mind and up to a couple of thousand dollars extra from the higher interest as a reward for your vigilance.",

            "Description": "SINGAPORE - When she received an Instagram message telling her that her photos and personal information were being shared on a private Telegram group, Ms Glennice Tong got worried.The Instagram user, who appeared to be a woman, warned Ms Tong that the group was a 'remake' of the now-defunct Telegram group SG Nasi Lemak, where obscene photos and videos of women were shared.The student, 22, told The Straits Times (ST) that she had not taken such images.She said: 'The thought of there being another chat group like SG Nasi Lemak, and the idea of my photos on it and possibly more girls being harmed because of it were terrifying.'The SG Nasi Lemak group on Telegram had 44,000 members at its peak.One of its administrators was jailed and fined last year, while another man was given a mandatory treatment order. Two young people were given probation.Ms Tong said the woman appeared friendly and claimed she had already reported the chat group on her behalf, and suggested she do the same.Ms Tong asked for more information and was later sent a link to join the group.Speaking to ST on Jan 27, the same day she received the messages, Ms Tong said she became suspicious when the person claimed that aside from photos, there were screenshots of chats between her and a man.Ms Tong added: 'When she sent me a sketchy link to join the group, I knew it was a scam.'The link led her to what appeared to be the Facebook login page that required her to key in her phone number and subsequently an OTP that would be sent to her number.Ms Tong did not fill in her particulars and made a police report less than an hour later.The police confirmed a report was lodged. Ms Tong said: 'Such scams are really scary because it is a genuine fear for many girls that their photos will get circulated. They may do anything to take them down.'Ms Tong also posted a video on TikTok warning young women to be wary of such scams. Ms Reiane Ng, 19, experienced such scams twice over the past three months.The polytechnic student said she received a message on Facebook in late November telling her that her private details, including her address, were being shared on a private Facebook forum page.Ms Ng was told to key in her e-mail address and password on what appeared to be a Facebook login page.She said: 'I almost wanted to give them my details, but I remembered the same thing happened to another girl who was warning her friends on Instagram not to fall for it.'Ms Ng encountered a similar scam on Jan 21 when she was told on Instagram that there was a private Facebook forum sharing leaked nude photos of Singaporean girls, including hers.She said: 'I was scared, but also suspicious as she said there were mirror photos of me being circulated even though I did not take such photos. She also said she reported the group for me, which made it seem like she was looking out for me.' When Ms Ng saw the link, she knew it was a scam as the URL included strings of random letters and symbols. Ms Ng did not make a police report, but warned her friends on social media about the messages.Three other women also commented on social media they have received similar messages.Dr Annabelle Chow, principal clinical psychologist at Annabelle Psychology, said such scams are elaborately designed to induce victims' sense of urgency to respond.She said: 'Scammers are getting more creative. They are preying on the women's fears their photos will spread across different platforms.'Dr Chow added that when scammers say they have reported the chat group, this triggers a positive response from the victim, who will be likely to trust them.She said: 'There is a lot of emotional manipulation at play.' Mr Yeo Siang Tiong, general manager for South-east Asia at cyber-security firm Kaspersky, said such scams are likely to be a complex case of phishing.Mr Yeo said cyber criminals hope to instil panic and fear to trick people into providing confidential information by pressuring them to reply quickly or issuing ultimatums.He advised users to resist the pressure to act immediately in such situations.Mr Yeo said: 'Even if a message comes from someone you know, remember their accounts can also be hacked. Always treat links and attachments with great care.'In an advisory issued online, the police said users should never input sensitive information to pop-up windows from e-mails or websites and never download or open attachments in e-mails from unfamiliar sources.Users should also never feel pressured to reveal any personal information online.Those with information related to such crimes can call the police hotline on 1800-255-0000, or submit it online on the iWitness website.The public can also visit the Scam Alert website or call the Anti-Scam Hotline on 1800-722-6688.",

            "Description": "SINGAPORE - The recent phishing saga involving customers of OCBC Bank has highlighted the epidemic of scams in Singapore, where victims have lost more than $965 million in just over 5½ years, checks by The Straits Times showed.Scammers pocketed a record high $268.4 million in total in 2020, a figure Home Affairs and Law Minister K. Shanmugam revealed last year in a written response to a parliamentary question on scams.It was nearly triple the $89.7 million stolen in 2016.The authorities have acknowledged the difficulties in tackling the problem - many of the perpetrators are based overseas, and when the monies have been transferred, recovery has been hard.But the police have had some success.Their Anti-Scam Centre said that of the 7,400 scam reports it received in the first half of last year involving losses of more than $201.7 million, the authorities were able to recover $66 million.Internet love scams have remained one of the most lucrative scams in Singapore since 2011.The amount duped from victims has grown from $2.3 million in 2011 to $8.8 million in 2014 and $33.1 million in 2020.Police said 90 per cent of the scams in Singapore had originated from overseas.They added that they have worked closely with foreign law enforcement agencies to monitor and share information on emerging scams and conduct joint operations to cripple syndicates.The police said that last year, the Anti-Scam Division (ASD) of the Commercial Affairs Department worked with the Royal Malaysia Police, Hong Kong Police Force and the police force in Taiwan. 'Sixteen transnational syndicates perpetrating job scams, Internet love scams and impersonation scams were busted,' the police said.ASD oversees the Anti-Scam Centre.Speaking to the media on Thursday (Jan 27), Deputy Assistant Commissioner (DAC) of Police Aileen Yap said the joint operations led to the arrest of 230 suspected syndicate members. DAC Yap is the assistant director of the Commercial Affairs Department's ASD. In Singapore, police also arrested and investigated more than 7,000 scammers and money mules last year.Some are believed to have rented out their bank accounts to scammers or assisted them by carrying out bank transfers and withdrawals.The Covid-19 pandemic has not slowed down the syndicates, with more victims falling for job scams, the Anti-Scam Centre said. In the first six months of last year, there were 658 cases of job scams - a 16-fold increase from just 40 in the same period in 2020.'Scammers are quick to adapt their tactics and scripts to keep up with the current climate.'During the pandemic, scammers have impersonated government officials to phish for personal particulars from victims,' police said. Criminologist Olivia Choy, from Nanyang Technological University's psychology department, said financial and emotional stress triggered by the pandemic could have made people more vulnerable to scams.'Such stressors can lead to poorer decision-making, and with more people going online for work and leisure, there is an influx of potential victims for opportunistic scammers,' she added.Additional reporting by David SunCorrection note: This article has been edited for clarity.

            "Description": "SINGAPORE - The case of a man, 21, believed to have been kidnapped took an unexpected turn when the police found that the victim and his family had transferred more than $560,000 to scammers impersonating officials from China.Acting on a scammer's instructions, the victim had isolated himself in a hotel room in Singapore and recorded videos of himself with his hands placed behind his back to convince his family in China that he was in trouble, the police said in a statement on Monday (Jan 31).The Straits Times understands that he complied because he was threatened by the scammers.Last Friday, the police received a report at about 1.30am that a 21-year-old man had allegedly been kidnapped.Based on the report, the police learnt that his family had been receiving videos of the victim and ransom demands from an unknown person with a Fujian accent who was believed to be in China.Officers from the Tanglin Police Division, Criminal Investigation Department and Commercial Affairs Department were activated and conducted an extensive search operation and investigations to locate the victim.He was eventually found to be safe in a hotel on the same day at about 9.30am, about eight hours after the police report was made.Preliminary investigations revealed the victim had received an unsolicited call purportedly from an officer from the Ministry of Health in November last year.The victim's call was later redirected to other scammers who claimed to be police officers from China, the police said.The scammers allegedly claimed that the victim was involved in money laundering offences in China and sought his cooperation to help their investigations.Between Dec 22 last year and last Monday, the victim, who was also allegedly threatened, and his parent transferred more than $560,000 to bank accounts provided by the scammer on several occasions.In the statement, the police reminded the public that China Police, Interpol and other overseas law enforcement agencies have no jurisdiction to conduct operations in Singapore, arrest anyone or ask members of the public to help with any form of investigations without the approval of the Singapore Government. The latest incident follows a string of cases over the past three years involving parents being duped by people impersonating China officials claiming their children had been kidnapped.Since 2019, China officials impersonation scams have ranked among the top five scams here, with a total of $49.5 million lost in the first half of 2021.In November 2021, an 18-year-old man was found to be safe at a rented flat a day after the police received a report that he had been kidnapped.Acting on the scammer’s instructions, the victim recorded a video of himself with his hands placed behind his back to help in purported investigations.Without his knowledge, the scammer sent a video to his parents in China and demanded a ransom to be paid for his release.In May 2021, a 21-year-old student posed topless, blindfolded and gagged while on a video call because he believed he was taking an X-ray via the phone as instructed by a scammer impersonating a police officer from China.The scammer then sent the recording to his parents in China to demand a ransom of 6 million yuan (S$1.2 million).In May 2019, a 15-year-old student was scammed into staging his own kidnapping, leading to his parents transferring 20,000 yuan (S$4,045) to a bank account in China.In 2020, scammers pocketed a record high of $268.4 million in total, which was nearly triple the $89.7 million stolen in 2016.The police warned the public to take the following precautions when they receive unsolicited calls from unknown parties, especially those with the '+' prefix that indicates they originate from overseas callers. No government agency will instruct payment through undocumented media like a telephone call or a social messaging platform such as WeChat, or ask for personal banking information such as Internet banking passwords, the police said.Foreign residents who receive calls from people claiming to be police officers or government officials from their home country should call their embassy or High Commission to verify the claims of the callers, they added.The police warned against giving personal information, bank details and one-time passwords to anyone. The public should also avoid making any fund transfer if the caller is of dubious identity.They are also advised to call a trusted friend or talk to a relative before they act, as they may be overwhelmed by emotion and make wrong judgments.Those with information on such scams can call the police hotline on 1800-255-0000 or dial 999.For scam-related advice, the public can call the anti-scam helpline on 1800-722-6688 or visit this website.",

Fake mobile app Victims are told to download mobile applications from unverified websites so they can supposedly accept lucrative jobs using the app.They are told to transfer funds to bank accounts or cryptocurrency wallets provided by the scammer.In return, they are promised a commission after a number of assigned tasks is completed. Such tasks appear to be aiding businesses.The supposed commission they have 'earned' is then reflected in the mobile app.But when victims try to cash out, they realise they are unable to do so.2. Warning letter The second type appears to have evolved from the first.Those who fall victim to the first type and try to quit and cash out will be sent warning letters that bear fake letterheads of the local authorities.Victims are pressured into making further transfers into bank accounts or cryptocurrency wallets to avoid having legal action purportedly taken against them.3. Easy part-time job Victims are told they can earn a commission by completing easy tasks, such as liking social media posts, as part of purported part-time affiliate marketing jobs.They are led to websites that entice them to sign up for packages in order to be offered such jobs, with the amount of commission they are to be purportedly paid depending on the package they pay for.They are then told to transfer money to the bank accounts of unknown individuals as payment for the packages.But they soon find that they do not get paid, and they are unable to withdraw the supposed commissions. 4. Movie tickets Scammers convince victims they can earn a commission by buying and selling movie tickets through an unverified app that they are instructed to download.Victims are told they have to top up their app accounts to buy the movie tickets and would purportedly receive a commission from ticket sales.The scammers then provide the victims with bank accounts belonging to unknown individuals for payment to be made.But, as with the previous scam, the victims do not get paid and they are unable to withdraw the purported commissions. 5. Shopee Pay Victims are told to download a fake mobile app called 'Shopee Pay' from an unverified website to place orders from which they would receive commissions.The app, which is unrelated to e-commerce platform Shopee, looks legitimate as scammers are spoofing an actual platform. The unverified app is a spoof of Shopee’s real digital wallet called ShopeePay, which is accessed through the real Shopee app.Shopee does not have a standalone app for its digital wallet.Victims are instructed to deposit funds into their Shopee Pay account so they can place the orders. Depositing the funds requires them to purchase cryptocurrency and transfer it to another wallet.The Shopee Pay app then reflects the funds they have supposedly deposited.But when the victims try to cash out, they are unable to do so or have their accounts suspended.

It urged those who had previously done so to lodge a police report.Iras added that any genuine corporate income tax and goods and services tax (GST) refunds will be credited directly to the user's bank account.For property tax and personal income tax refunds, Iras will either credit the refund directly to the user's bank account, through telegraphic transfer or send cheques if they do not pay taxes via the electronic direct debit system Giro.'If Iras requires information from you, Iras will not disclose nor solicit your personal details or any confidential information via e-mail or unsecured web links,' said the authority.'Iras officers will direct you to use the relevant forms secured by Singpass login or sign-up links located on the Iras website to furnish your personal details and bank account information, if required.'The warning comes as the tax filing period approaches.

Recipients were told to open a new bank account, or reply to the e-mail sender with their bank account details.Last August, Iras also highlighted suspicious WhatsApp calls in which scammers would inform recipients that they faced a penalty for unpaid taxes.The scammers would also ask to verify credit card details for the payment of the penalty.Iras has said it does not send taxpayers' payment statements and tax notices over e-mail.

            "Description": "SINGAPORE - Scams are on the rise. Nearly 470 OCBC Bank customers lost at least $8.5 million to a spate of SMS phishing scams last month, and other banks such as DBS and UOB recently warned of similar scams impersonating bank employees.Here are some of the most common types of scams going around.1. SMS phishing scamsIn the recent scams involving OCBC Bank, fraudsters sent SMS messages claiming to be from the bank to trick its customers.Some scammers have made use of the same sender identification labels used by the legitimate banks when sending fake SMS messages.For example, some of the SMS messages sent to OCBC customers seemed to have been sent by 'OCBC' and appeared in the same message thread as previous genuine messages.The messages often claim there is a problem with the recipient's bank account that needs to be resolved urgently, and include a link to a fake website that resembles the real one.Victims who enter their log-in information and one-time passwords (OTP) on the fake website can quickly have their accounts breached and their savings stolen.2. Impersonation scamsAnother type of phishing scam involves crooks posing as authority figures such as the police, job recruiters or government officials.Using SMS messages, e-mails or phone calls, they try to convince potential victims to part with money or give up sensitive information such as banking log-in details or personal data such as NRIC numbers.A variant involves fake bank hotline numbers being listed on Google search results. Victims who call these numbers will be connected to scammers pretending to be bank staff.Common tactics involve claiming the recipient has got into legal trouble, or offering simple yet well-paid part-time jobs and investment schemes with high interest rates. Victims who respond are asked to pay fees or provide personal information.The police, the Supreme Court and the Central Provident Fund (CPF) Board recently warned the public of such scams.Amid the Covid-19 pandemic, many scammers also pretended to be calling from the Health Ministry and claimed they were requesting information for contact tracing purposes.They often mask the caller ID number to appear as a local number starting with the Singapore country code '+65', even though they may be calling from overseas.Scammers may also pose as one's contacts. E-mail addresses, for example, can be spoofed to appear as if the message was sent by a colleague or friend requesting money for urgent personal needs. 3. E-commerce and delivery scamsScams involving fake item listings often take place on e-commerce marketplaces, auction sites or trading features on social media platforms.The most common type involves listing high-demand items such as gaming consoles or concert tickets for unusually low prices, which tempts users who are looking for a bargain.Once payment has been made, the 'seller' disappears or becomes unresponsive, and the would-be buyer never receives the promised item.Some scammers claim to be offering 'pre-orders' that will take some time to arrive in Singapore, which can cause victims to delay making a complaint or report.Another related scam involves unsolicited SMS messages or e-mails claiming the recipient's parcel is stuck in transit and that a fee must be paid to ensure delivery. Victims sometimes fall for such claims even if they had not ordered any item. 4. Love scamsPosing as attractive potential partners, scammers usually target vulnerable victims on dating and social media platforms, often using stolen photos on their profiles.After befriending the victims and gaining their trust, the scammers spin a tale about falling on hard times and ask for money.They may also demand gifts or money as proof of the victim's love, or claim they need the money to arrange a visit to the victim's country.Another common ruse is for scammers to invite their smitten victims to buy into fake investment schemes or business ventures.",

            "Description": "SINGAPORE - Some OCBC Bank customers who lost money in the recent SMS scams were puzzled that they did not get one-time passwords (OTPs) in SMSes sent by the bank to verify the unauthorised transactions.One possible explanation from OCBC is that the bank's digital authentication tool to verify transactions was activated on the scammers' phones with banking details phished from victims.Cyber-security experts said it was possible that the SMS OTPs were intercepted by malware on victims' phones, or were diverted to overseas telcos that had been hacked.Nearly 470 customers lost at least $8.5 million in fraudulent fund transfers in December last year after scammers spoofed the name OCBC uses in its SMSes and sent SMSes to victims with links to phishing sites.Many victims reportedly fell for the ruse because the fake SMSes were grouped by their phones with legitimate SMSes previously sent by the bank for OTPs and transaction alerts.One ruse involves using the bank's digital authentication process in which a customer receives a phishing SMS with a link to a fake bank login website, the bank said on Monday (Jan 17).When the customer enters his bank username or access code and bank account PIN on the fake site, the scammer steals these details and keys them into the bank's mobile banking app on his device. This allows him to perform multiple transactions up to the daily transfer limit.The scammer then activates OCBC's OneToken, used for authenticating digital banking transactions, on the banking app. This triggers the sending of an SMS OTP to the customer's registered mobile phone, where he is then prompted by the phishing site to enter with his bank card PIN.With the token activated, the crook can extract more money from the victim's compromised account by adding local and overseas recipients of funds, as well as raising the daily transfer limit.The scammer can verify fund transfers by replying to a prompt on the banking app without any SMS OTPs, so the victim does not get an SMS.However, the customer could get an SMS notification for a digital token being activated but may be unaware that the activation is for the fraudster's device.Cyber-security expert Anthony Lim, who is also a fellow at the Singapore University of Social Sciences, said it is possible that some victims' banking details were phished in previous attempts.Malware on the victims' phones may have deleted the messages, postulated Mr Kevin Reed, chief information security officer of cyber-security firm Acronis. The Association of Banks in Singapore had warned in 2015 about malware on mobile phones that let hackers intercept SMS OTPs and use them for fraudulent transactions.Mr Reed said this is more likely to happen on Android phones where apps could request SMS access, although iPhones could be vulnerable if there is a flaw in the mobile operating system.Crooks could also have hacked into victims' bank accounts with stolen login details, and changed the phone numbers associated with the accounts so that SMS OTPs are delivered to the hacker instead of the account holder.But some banks may have measures against this, said Mr Reed, such as requiring a physical visit to the bank, having a cool-down period, or sending notifications of the change to both the new and old phone numbers so that the owner of the latter can reverse the change if it is malicious.In some cases, scammers might turn off notifications, so victims do not get alerts on fraudulent transactions, he said. Hackers could also delay or delete SMSes by breaching the SS7 mobile phone network, a mobile infrastructure for data management. It allows them to spoof SMS sender names, too.Hackers could also spoof victims' phone numbers such that they receive a copy of SMS OTPs.It is possible that some SMS OTPs were diverted abroad by scammers, like what happened in cases the authorities highlighted in September last year.The crooks hacked into the systems of overseas telcos and used them to change the location information of the mobile phone numbers used by Singapore victims, said Mr Reed.This tricked Singapore telco networks into thinking the Singapore numbers were roaming overseas on other countries' networks. So, when banks sent SMS OTPs, these were diverted to the overseas mobile network systems and stolen by the hackers.The best protection is to 'not rely on SMS for strong authentication at all' or to confirm sensitive actions, said Mr Reed.OCBC advises customers not to click on links in SMSes claiming to direct them to the bank's website. Instead, they should use the bank's official mobile banking app or type www.ocbc.com directly into their Web browsers.If in doubt, they should call the OCBC hotline on 6363-3333 and not any numbers cited in an SMS. Customers can also download the ScamShield app for iOS devices from the authorities to block unsolicited messages and calls.They should not give sensitive information such as login names, passwords and OTPs to anyone or key them into unverified websites.Said Mr Lim: 'One should typically be suspicious, sceptical or at least not be impatient when dealing with unsolicited messages, especially those pertaining to an important personal asset like a bank account.'",

            "Description": "SINGAPORE - Some residents this month received a plain white envelope with the words 'Do not ignore this letter' and a Singapore Police Force crest and tagline in the corner - leading to questions about its authenticity.The letter is in fact an anti-scam awareness initiative by the Ang Mo Kio Police Division, sent to all 316,000 households under its jurisdiction, the police told The Sunday Times on Saturday (Jan 15).A spokesman said: 'The letter was designed to capture the attention of residents and generate interest among them.'We applied behavioural insights principles, for example in the use of large fonts and red text, to 'nudge' residents to take action to read the advisories and spread the message,' he added.But residents who received it said that after being initially intrigued, they lost interest and some wound up binning the letter once they realised it was part of a genuine police anti-scam campaign.Contained within the envelope is a note signed off by the area's police division commander, warning of the danger of falling victim to 'relentless' scammers targeting hard-earned savings.It describes how scammers - largely operating from overseas - make their approach through the likes of unsolicited text messages and e-mails.Prevalent types of scams involve job offers, investment opportunities and phishing, where scammers claim to represent trusted entities like the Government or banks, and convince victims to divulge sensitive information such as passwords.The note is accompanied by a leaflet depicting signs of scams, including asking for funds to be transferred, or deals that are too good to be true.People are also advised to give some thought and check or confirm details before taking any action.The police said they would be sending similar fliers islandwide by the end of February.Before sending out the letters, six neighbourhood police centres under Ang Mo Kio Police Division posted a teaser on their Facebook pages, to encourage residents to look out for the letters and not ignore them, said the police.On Jan 7, for example, the Facebook page for Punggol Neighbourhood Police Centre had said the letter 'contains an important message' and is 'not a scam'. Some discussion has taken place online - including over 1,300 'upvotes' on the Reddit platform - with writers either pointing out its contents or continuing to wonder if it might be fake.Regional sourcing manager Leonard Low, 34, said he was 'suspicious' of the letter's origins before he opened it up but quickly realised it was a caution about scams.'I didn't bother to read the letter in detail,' he added. A full-time national serviceman, who wanted to be known only as Adam, said he was initially 'jumpy' about receiving a letter with an ominous-sounding instruction.'But upon seeing the lack of an address, I assumed it was just one of those mailers,' said the 23-year-old.'Since it was a generic letter, I just read through it and threw it in the trash.'The note inside also points to 'rising cases of scams in Singapore', giving the example of how 'recently, a Singaporean woman lost $3 million to an online scam'.Banking scams have been in the headlines of late.In December, at least 469 people were duped by a text message purportedly from OCBC Bank. They lost $8.5 million in total.On Thursday, the police said at least 1,200 cases of phishing scams have been reported since December.A public education campaign was launched in August 2020 with a slogan 'Spot the Signs. Stop the Crimes'. This tagline was reproduced in the leaflet within the police's recent 'Do not ignore this letter' initiative.'Through this mailer, we hope to raise public awareness of (scam) types and to enable the public to better protect themselves against these scams,' the police said on Saturday.Those with information on scams can call the police hotline on 1800-255-0000, or submit it online at the iWitness website.For more information on scams, the public can visit the Scam Alert website or call the Anti-Scam Hotline on 1800-722-6688.They can also sign up to receive up-to-date messages at the Scam Alert website.",

            "Description": "SINGAPORE - It took a man and his wife five years to save about $120,000, but in just 30 minutes, scammers using a fake text message stole the money they had kept in their OCBC Bank joint savings account.The couple in their 20s were among at least 469 people who reportedly fell victim to phishing scams involving OCBC in the last two weeks of December last year.The victims lost around $8.5 million in total.Speaking to The Sunday Times, the couple, who declined to be identified, said they had been saving up to start a family. They have not been able to get their money back.The husband works in the e-commerce sector, while his wife is in the hospitality industry. The man said he received the phishing message with a link at around noon on Dec 21 last year.It claimed that an unknown payee had been added to their account, and instructed him to click on the link if it was not approved by him.'The SMS looked like it came from OCBC and entered the usual SMS chat history from OCBC used for authentic banking services,' he said.'The link took me to a site that looked exactly like the OCBC login page.'He then entered his account details, unwittingly handing over control of the whole account to scammers.The couple realised they had been scammed only when the man received SMSes from the bank informing him of changes and transactions involving the account that had taken place earlier that afternoon.He showed ST his text message history. According to the time stamp, the bank sent him the alert at about 2pm, only for him to receive it past 6pm.'Had we received the notifications on time, we would have been able to react faster, and perhaps been able to reach the relevant teams during the same business day to stop the transactions,' said the man.ST understands that it is possible the scammers had re-routed or delayed the SMSes. The couple had also received messages earlier that access to their account was being set up on another phone, but this was followed with fake messages from the scammer telling them to ignore the messages, claiming they were just part of a system upgrade. After news broke that others had also been scammed, the couple decided to start a group for victims in an attempt to collectively seek answers.Theirs was not the largest sum stolen. A 38-year-old software engineer who fell prey to the same scam on Dec 28 told ST that he lost about $250,000 he had been saving since 2010.The father of a young child with special needs said the loss has been devastating, and he has been hiding it from his family.'It's a horrible situation that impacts my whole life,' he said.'I didn't know there was a scam going around... how would I have known?'Eight victims have contacted ST to share their frustration.Responding to queries from ST, Mr Francisco Celio, head of group corporate security at OCBC, said it has been assisting those affected.'The recent SMS phishing scam impersonated OCBC and preyed on the fears of consumers about their personal bank accounts,' he said.'It is particularly aggressive and highly sophisticated in duping consumers into disclosing their personal banking details despite repeated bank warnings to be alert and not to do so.'The bank said it has since halted its plans to phase out physical hardware tokens by the end of March this year, and has also stopped sending SMSes with links in them in the light of the spate of phishing incidents. OCBC launched its fraud surveillance system in 2016, and uses machine learning to assist in detecting and immediately flagging fraudulent transactions, which are then reviewed by a fraud analyst.It also implemented its anti-financial malware system in 2019. It is able to identify what device its banking services are accessed from.Mr Celio added that OCBC's banking systems remain safe and secure and have not been hacked.A group of victims issued a statement to ST, alleging that the bank had not responded fast enough, failed to ensure the security of its SMS channel, and that remediation for customers was lacking.'While the attack may have been particularly aggressive, it is OCBC's duty to their customers to be ready for this,' they said.Cyber security expert Anthony Lim, who is also a fellow at the Singapore University of Social Sciences, said scammers have advanced software enabling them to spoof telecommunications services and send SMSes that appear in the same threads used by real organisations.He added that even if victims did not provide their one-time passwords (OTPs), they would have sealed their fate when they entered other bank details on the fraudulent sites.'Once the victim unwittingly responds by entering the bank account credentials, the hackers' technologies can divert and capture a copy of the SMS OTP issued by the bank,' he said.He also said there is a limit to how much a consumer can be protected, and that consumers need to be aware and protect themselves.'Quite unfortunately, with regard to such message scams, there is only so much technology can do (to protect consumers),' he said.'The best way to avoid falling prey to these is still awareness, and the accompanying scepticism.' Tips to avoid being scammedWith scammers using more advanced technologies and software, the simplest advice may work best - be suspicious of messages sent via SMS or WhatsApp asking for personal details.Cyber security expert Anthony Lim said consumers should take the following precautions when dealing with online transactions and banking details:• Do not act in a hurry or under duress• Do not respond to messages asking for personal credentials, passwords or PINs• Be suspicious of messages sent via SMS or WhatsApp asking for personal details• Never click on links in such messages• Never download any attached file in such messages, however interesting or attractive it may be made out to beSeparately, OCBC Bank advises consumers not to access their bank accounts through SMS links.Mobile access to bank accounts should always be done using the official banking or payment app, or by keying in the bank's URL directly into the browser.",

            "Description": "SINGAPORE - Since the start of December, at least 469 people have fallen prey to phishing scams involving OCBC Bank, with reported losses totalling at least $8.5 million.Most of the amount was lost over the past two weeks, said the police in a media release on Thursday evening (Dec 30).Over the Christmas weekend alone, OCBC said 186 customers lost about $2.7 million.Victims received unsolicited SMSes purporting to be from the bank, claiming there were issues with their banking accounts and they had to click on a link given in the message to resolve the issue.The link led to fake bank websites and victims were asked to key in their Internet banking account login details. They discovered that they had been scammed when they received notifications that there were unauthorised transactions in their bank accounts.'Once the funds have been fraudulently transferred out of the victim's bank account, it would be challenging and difficult to recover the stolen monies,' said the police.They added that OCBC Bank has warned its customers about the phishing SMSes via several channels, including its online banking platforms, social media page and media advisories.Having seen an increase in such phishing scams, the police are urging the public to follow crime prevention measures.First, do not click on dubious URL links provided in unsolicited text messages. OCBC will not send SMSes containing bit.ly links.Second, always verify the authenticity of the information with the official website or sources.Third, never disclose your personal or Internet banking details and one-time password to anyone.Lastly, fraudulent transactions should be reported to your bank immediately.The police urge anyone with information relating to such crimes to call their hotline at 1800-255-0000, or submit it online. Those who require urgent police assistance should dial 999.Despite advisories and warnings issued by the authorities throughout the year, scams of different varieties continue to be a scourge in Singapore. According to figures released by the police in end-August, scam victims lost $168 million to conmen in the top 10 scam categories in the first six months of this year alone.This was over 2½ times the amount lost to scammers in the same period in 2020. Loan scams had the highest number of reported cases among scam types, with victims cheated of $10.6 million. This was followed by e-commerce scams, which saw victims lose $2.4 million.Job and investment scams also surged significantly, with victims having lost $6.5 million, compared with last year’s $60,000.Investment scam victims, on the other hand, lost $66.2 million, which was more than triple the $21.6 million in the same period last year. The year-end shopping season has also seen the emergence of non-banking-related phishing scams.Since last month, more than 300 people have fallen prey to phishing scams involving delivery companies, amid the slew of year-end online shopping events.As at Dec 20, the police said there were at least 341 victims, who made losses amounting to at least $759,000. These victims typically received e-mails and text messages from scammers impersonating delivery companies such as SingPost, claiming that there were outstanding payments that had to be made before the parcel could be delivered.Victims were told to click on URL links to make payment, where they were asked to provide their card details and a one-time password. It was only later that they realised unauthorised transactions had been made with their card.

            "Description": "SINGAPORE - It might be the season of giving but people should beware of 'free gifts' such as iPhones and Samsung handsets from well-known brands seeking feedback - it might just be a scam.Cyber-security firm Group-IB on Tuesday (Dec 21) warned that there has been a spike in a type of scam that gleans information from unsuspecting victims and uses the data to trick them into thinking they could win prizes from brands, particularly telecommunication firms, by participating in polls.Local telcos contacted did not comment directly on the scam but advised customers to be vigilant.The scam uses what Group-IB called a 'targeted link' directed at victims. It was first seen in 2018, with crooks exploiting dozens of brands globally, but this year, the number has jumped to at least 121 brands across 91 countries.Scammers mostly posed as telecoms firms, with more than half of the brands exploited worldwide coming from the sector. This was followed by e-commerce and retail brands.In Singapore, scammers targeted telecoms firms as well. In 2019, scams exploiting two brands were found - both involved presenting themselves as popular telecoms brands. The number of brands rose to five this year, and included entertainment and electronics manufacturing brands.The increase could be due to the success of the initial scams and the Covid-19 pandemic, said Mr Ilia Rozhnov, head of Group-IB's digital risk protection unit in the Asia-Pacific.'The pandemic has fuelled more fears. You can hardly expect critical thinking from stressed-out and fearful citizens. People are overwhelmed with coronavirus fears. And scammers capitalise on that,' he added.This comes amid a general rise in scams here by 16 per cent in the first half of this year, from the same period a year ago, the police said in August.The targeted-link scam works by first putting out a message to potential victims through digital marketing, including through advertisements on social media platforms, SMS texts, e-mails and website pop-up windows.To evade detection and blocking, the initial message does not mention specific brands and has a link in the form of a shortened URL to mask the real address.The message promises victims that they can win valuable prizes by completing a survey or joining a lucky draw.Once a person clicks on the link, he is redirected to various sites that gather information about the victim, such as the country he is in, his language preference and time zone. Using the details, a targeted link is created, which finally redirects the victim to a phishing site passing off as one from a well-known brand in the victim's country.This phishing site asks the victim to take part in a poll, such as to give feedback on the impersonated brand, but within a time limit.To presumably get the prize after that, the victim is urged to fill a form asking for his personal data, such as his full name, e-mail address, postal address, phone number and bank card details. They may sometimes be asked to pay a tax or a test payment before they can receive the prize. Fraudsters can use the stolen data to buy goods online, register fake user accounts, or sell the victims' details on the Dark Web.The targeted link can be opened only once and only by the intended victim. Group-IB said this means that such links do not stick around for long, which makes it harder to detect them, and hampers investigations and takedowns of the scam.The company expects the targeted-link scam to evolve, cover new brands, and expand its reach next year, due in part to the ongoing pandemic driving scams globally and more time spent online by people.Telcos said they would never ask customers for personal data such as NRIC numbers and passwords over the phone, e-mail, SMS, surveys and suspicious links and sites.Singtel said that it was 'extremely concerning' that scammers keep targeting customers of telcos and other service providers to prey on people's trust, adding that it has a scam awareness campaign.StarHub said that if customers have any questions about the validity of e-mails, SMS texts or social media advertisements, they should contact the telco directly to verify.Among the safeguards M1 said it has put in place is one that involves working with the authorities to take down scam sites, where possible. To further protect themselves against targeted link scams, Group-IB said consumers should not send money to anyone for prizes as this is not a practice of legitimate companies.It also advises consumers to always pay attention to the URL address of a site to check if it looks suspicious and to not trust promotions that have a quick countdown timer.Bank card details should be entered only into trusted websites, and people should always check on links before opening them, even if they come from a friend or relative, said Group-IB.",

She then spoke to another person who identified himself as Inspector Lim from the Singapore Police Force, who said they would investigate further. Following the incident on Oct 22, Ms Megan, 59, received a flurry of phone calls from 'police officers' over six days, asking her to provide personal particulars and give them access to her banking details to check whether there was any unusual activity.They turned out to be a group of scammers who were foiled when they tried to set up an account with digital-asset trading firm QCP Capital, which suspected something was amiss and raised an alert with the police.On Friday (Dec 17), Ms Megan met the media via a Zoom call organised by the police and gave details of the scam involving $500,000, hoping that others will learn from her experience and would not fall for such tricks.“If it can happen to me, it can happen to a lot of people. It can be just that moment in time when you are a bit vulnerable and something clicks, so you need to be constantly alert and don’t assume you cannot be scammed,” said the management executive, who has been working in the IT industry for the past 20 years.QCP Capital played a critical role in foiling what is billed as a Government Officials Impersonation Scam.The company noticed discrepancies while performing checks as part of its new customer onboarding process and within two hours of suspecting something was amiss, staff alerted the police to a possible case of cheating and officers from the Anti-Scam Centre of the Commercial Affairs Department responded to the case.Ms Megan was duly alerted and froze her bank account immediately.Mr Lim Jin Li, co-founder and director of QCP Capital, said the scammers submitted accurate personal details about Ms Megan, including her NRIC number and scans of her passport.“But just because somebody submits accurate information (it) does not mean the application is genuine, so we do have numerous ways of detecting fraud – a combination of technology and manual review,” he added, unwilling to go into further detail because of the sensitive and confidential nature of their protocols.In a statement on Friday, the police said that between January and September this year, there were at least 50 victims who were deceived by scammers impersonating High Court officials, with at least $6.8 million lost. The police reminded the public to be “vigilant and wary of persons who may impersonate government officials”.“The police will not request victims to assist in their investigation by providing their bank account numbers, Internet banking username and password,” the police said in the statement.“No government official would also identify themselves by sending a picture of their warrant cards, or official documents via social media app as these are confidential documents.”In her particular case, Ms Megan, who is single, said the scammers sounded like Singaporeans, which helped to convince her the situation was real. She added that the “officers” told her not to tell anyone about the ongoing case.“I always pride myself in being very data-driven, methodical and not someone who is easily flustered. I got thrown off-guard and I let fear paralyse me,” she added.Those who have information related to such crimes, or are in doubt, please call the police hotline at 1800-255-0000, or submit it at the iWitness website.

An alleged scammer, who was seen dressed to look like a personnel from the Singapore Police Force, appeared to have been improving his appearance to look more like the real deal.This was after he was called out in late November for being lazy in not wearing the correct cap, while exposing his chest hair, which is highly unprofessional because the Singapore Police Force will never allow that.Also, the alleged scammer of south Asian descent, was accused of cold calling people on this island in an attempt to make his callers part with their money using nothing but his words and appearance, yet did not work hard enough at lowering people's guard by maintaining his credibility first.Improved appearance But a week of insults and feedback has since done him some good.Previously, the alleged scammer's cap displayed a recognisable New York Yankees logo beside a faux SPF logo -- a low quality simulation. In his latest makeover, Johnny Scammer donned a dark cap devoid of logos. He also buttoned up his shirt to hide his unkempt chest hair and stop them from peeking out from underneath the fabric, as it was his previous untidy appearance that gave him away as a low-cost cosplayer.His eyebrows also appeared trimmed now.To add a touch of officialdom, the alleged scammer even put on a blue lanyard to show he can exude authority because anyone in a position of power owns one at some point while floating up the hierarchy to reach the higher rungs of authority.However, another photo of the scammer has emerged, which showed that he might still have his work cut out for him.Because his cap now has the Adidas logo. viaCould be different scammer But, of course, the other scammer and this current one might not even be the same person, and both just happen to share the same modus operandi.If they are different, apologies are in order for associating the current alleged scammer with the less effortful alleged scammer previously.Regardless, this is the phone number on caller ID of the better groomed scammer.

The fake offer displays the device being sold along with deals like 'unlimited internet call' and 'S$5/month' plans.

Purchase only from authorised sellers or reputable sources, especially for high value items,' SPF said.The police advised members of the public to be wary of purported time-sensitive deals due to limited stocks available and avoid making upfront payments to bank accounts belonging to unknown individuals.They should instead opt for buyer protection by using in-built payment options that release payment to the seller only upon delivery. Whenever possible, avoid making advance payments or direct bank transfers to the seller as this method does not offer any protection.In these situations, it is important to verify the sellerâs profile on online marketplaces through customer reviews and ratings.If any member of the public has information related to such crimes or are in doubt, they can call the police hotline at 1800-255-0000, or submit the information online.Otherwise, seek scam-related advice by visiting this website or calling the anti-scam hotline at 1800-722-6688.Follow and listen to our podcast here  Top images via SPF.Â",

One involves fake mobile applications and the other relates to purported warning letters sent via WhatsApp.In the first scenario, police said victims are first told to download an app that will lead to jobs. However, before they can use the app, they must first top up funds.To do so, victims have to transfer money to a specified bank account, or convert the amount into cryptocurrency and then transfer the sum into digital wallets specified by the scammers.Police said that in this scam, victims were promised a commission after a certain number of tasks have been completed.To make it more believable, the amount the victims transferred was reflected in their digital wallets.The victims were also told that commission earned from jobs will be banked into the same digital wallets.'However, the victims then realised that they have been scammed when they were unable to withdraw the money from these accounts,' said police.In the WhatsApp scam, victims received fake warning letters telling them to pay a severance fee if they no longer wished to continue with jobs the scammers had arranged.The victims were warned that their accounts on the app would be frozen, preventing them from withdrawing their commission, and that legal action could be taken against them if they were to discontinue with the 'job'.

At this point, the scammer would also promise commissions only after a required number of tasks had been completed.Thereafter, the scammers would allegedly say that the payments were delayed or withheld, and the victims would subsequently realise that they have been scammed after they did not receive the reimbursement and commission as promised.The joint operation According to the press release, the SPF and the RMP collaborated and shared information extensively which led up to the arrest of the scammers.On Aug. 26, officers from the CCID raided an apartment in Johor and arrested three Malaysian men aged between 21 and 27 years old.Preliminary investigations revealed that the group targeted Singaporean and Malaysian victims and laundered their ill-gotten gains in Malaysia.Meanwhile, officers fromÂ CAD also arrested six men and a woman, aged between 16 and 23, for their suspected involvement in theseÂ job scams.They had allegedly facilitated the scam syndicateâs crimes by carrying out bank transfers, funds withdrawals, and allowing the syndicate to use their bank accounts for monetary gains.David Chew, director at CAD thanked their Malaysian counterparts 'for their strong support and commitment in tackling transnational crime syndicates' that target Singaporeans.SPF advice to the public on crime prevention The SPF further advised the public to observe crime prevention measures such as not accepting 'dubious job offers that offer lucrative returns for minimal effort'.Additionally, the public should always verify the authenticity of the job with the official e-commerce platforms and refrain from accessing suspicious URLs and applications from unknown sources, the SPF said.When in doubt, members of the public can also call the anti-scam helpline at 1800-722-6688 or visit the scam alert website.Follow and listen to our podcast here  Top image via @a_d_s_w/Unsplash & Clint Patterson/Unsplash",

You can't remember me?'.In such cases, the victims reply to the caller with the names of their friends who they believed was the caller.Then, the caller assumes the identity of one of the mentioned friends and claims to have lost their mobile phone or changed their contact number.'The caller would contact the victims subsequently, asking for a loan due to financial difficulties or because they got into trouble with the law,' the police said.The victims are then asked to transfer the money to bank accounts.The police said: 'Victims would only discover that they had been scammed when they contacted their friends and realised that they had not contacted the victims nor changed their contact number.'The police advised people to be wary of unusual requests received, even if they appeared to be from family or friends, and to never send money to people they do not know or have not met in person.Check with the family member or friend who purportedly made the request through alternative means, such as physical meet-ups or using previously established contact details, the police added.Those with information on such scams can call the police on 1800-255-0000 or submit it at this website.More scam-related advice can be found via the anti-scam hotline on 1800-722-6688 or at this website.",

            "Description": "SINGAPORE - Sixteen people were cheated by scammers who posed as officers from the Singapore Police Force (SPF) between January and July, with one losing $1.7 million.The police raised the alert on this variant of government official impersonation scams in a statement on Monday (Aug 2).The victims had received unsolicited robocalls purportedly from the Singapore High Court. The calls were supposedly transferred to a police officer, who informed the victims that they were being investigated for money-laundering activities.The conversations are then moved onto messaging apps Line or WhatsApp, with non-users instructed to download either of them. Those on Line would also be added to a chat group called Reporting Platform.The victims are then purportedly shown a fake SPF warrant card and fake letters indicating that they are under investigation.They would then be instructed to surrender their money for investigation by transferring their money to various bank accounts controlled by the scammers.The victims were allegedly promised that the money transferred to these bank accounts would be returned to them upon the completion of the investigation.They discovered that they had been scammed only when the scammer asked for further fund transfers and did not return the money transferred earlier.In their statement, the police emphasised that they will not instruct members of the public to transfer money to bank accounts for investigation.They added that no local government agency will request personal details or money transfers over the phone or through automated voice machines.Police officers will also not identify themselves with the SPF warrant card on online platforms. Police urged the public to take the following precautions if they receive such unsolicited robocalls:- Ignore the calls and the callers' instructions.- Do not provide your name, identification number, passport details, contact details, bank account details, credit card details or other banking information such as usernames and passwords (including one-time password codes).- For foreign residents receiving calls from people claiming to be police officers or government officials from their home country, they should call their embassy to verify the claims of the callers.- Call a trusted friend or talk to a relative before you act, and do not be pressured by the caller to act impulsively.Those in doubt can dial 999 or approach a police officer at a nearby neighbourhood police centre.Those with information related to such crimes can call the police hotline on 1800-255-0000, or submit the information online at this website.For more information on scams, members of the public can visit this website or call the Anti-Scam Hotline on 1800-722-6688.",

            "Description": "SINGAPORE -A woman helped Nigerian scammers move more than $2 million out of Singapore, providing them with over 20 bank accounts to receive their criminal proceeds.Rohaiza Alap, 46, even recruited other people to act as money mules.She was jailed for seven years and four weeks on Monday (Aug 2). She had pleaded guilty last month to 15 charges, for offences committed between 2014 and 2017. These included eight of conspiring with others to provide bank accounts to receive criminal proceeds.Another 43 charges were taken into consideration by Senior District Judge Ong Hian Sun.In a joint statement on Monday, the police and the Attorney-General's Chambers (AGC) said Rohaiza's case involved a money-mule syndicate, with an organised and sophisticated network acting as a professional money-laundering group.The money came from various scams perpetrated by a group of Nigerians based in Malaysia, according to court documents.These included love scams in Singapore and business e-mail scams in other countries.Rohaiza began helping one of the scammers in September 2013, receiving scam proceeds through her bank accounts and later withdrawing the monies to pass to him. She had met him in January that year.She later assisted other scammers, some of whom she got to know through Facebook.The scammers would inform her in advance about the receipt of a sum of money. Once she received it in her bank account, she would withdraw the money and take a cut of it.Rohaiza would then hand the remaining sum to the scammers in Malaysia or to individuals in Singapore, on their instructions.Court documents state that Rohaiza was investigated by the police in 2014 and had some of her other accounts seized.But she continued with her offences and even set up two more bank accounts. Rohaiza also recruited seven individuals for her operation.One of them, Rohaizad Mahat, was sentenced in December 2019 to seven months' jail for his involvement. The rest have not been dealt with yet.Rohaiza would coordinate with them to receive the scam proceeds in their bank accounts and to transfer the monies back to the scammers. Both she and these others who provided bank accounts would take a cut from the proceeds.Court documents state that some of the people she recruited would also use the bank accounts of their companies to receive the monies.They state that she provided a total of 25 bank accounts to receive criminal proceeds, laundering over $1.35 million through them.Some of these accounts belonged to R & C Trading Enterprise, a business in which she was the sole proprietorIn all, Rohaiza helped the scammers move over $2 million out of Singapore, said AGC and the police.About $124,000 of the scam proceeds were seized by the Commercial Affairs Department (CAD) between Sept 25, 2014 and Nov 22, 2017.Court documents state that Rohaiza also sought to compromise police investigations by instructing another money mule, Aminorindah Haeruman, to lie to the CAD that the latter had no knowledge of the monies received in her bank accounts. On Monday, the court granted Rohaiza's request to defer her sentence to Sept 15, so that she can complete her Covid-19 vaccination and settle her business affairs.In their statement on Monday, the police and the AGC said scams perpetrated from overseas are of particular concern as 'it is difficult and nearly impossible' to recover monies once they are transferred out of Singapore.This is further compounded when scams are enabled by individuals who allow their bank accounts to be used by scammers to receive monies, hide their tracks and launder the criminal proceeds, the agencies added.'We will continue to work together to deter offenders from using Singapore's financial system as a refuge or conduit for illicit funds,' they said.",

            "Description": "SINGAPORE - More than $15,000 have been lost to scammers who falsely advertised the sale of crabs priced as low as $9.99.In these cases, several victims came across pop-up advertisements on the Internet and social media platforms offering cheap deals on crabs, sent from a restaurant known as 'Crabber Resto' or 'Jack Crab Resto', the police said in a statement on Tuesday (July 27).Upon clicking on the advert, victims were directed to a webpage with a selection of crabs that were purportedly discounted from $29.99 to $9.99. When making payment via credit or debit card, they were led to enter a one-time password (OTP) on the site.The victims never received the crabs they purchased and realised that they had been cheated only when they discovered unauthorised transactions made to their bank card.The police reminded members of the public to be sceptical when the price of a product is too good to be true and to purchase only from reputable sources, especially for expensive items.Cardholders should contact their card-issuing bank immediately if they receive an unexpected OTP without making any online transactions.They should also verify merchant details indicated in the OTP text message before providing the password.Buyers should always check that the amount deducted from their banking cards tallies with the amount they agreed to pay, and never disclose personal or Internet banking details to anyone, the police added.Those affected by similar scams can contact the police hotline on 1800-255-0000, or submit a report online at this website.",

There were 36 cases reported in 2019, with victims losing about $72,000 in all.This year's figures are not yet available, but the police issued a warning in May about a new trend of fake job scams. Such scams involve Facebook advertisements or unsolicited WhatsApp messages offering a part-time job as an affiliate marketing associate on e-commerce platforms.On June 16, Amanda responded to an offer - from the same foreign number on WhatsApp - of at least $200 per day for home-based work. The same day, she was assigned her first tasks by 'Wendy', who communicated with her only via WhatsApp.She was then told she could earn more commission on another online platform, where she would help to complete orders and earn a commission on the cart amounts, which varied.She had to register for an account on the platform and complete 60 orders a day to withdraw her earnings. On the platform's main page, she had to click a 'grab order' button, then click a submit button on a pop-up - a process that took under a minute.Wendy also gave her a referral code that supposedly gave her 16 per cent of her commission.On June 18, Amanda ran into a hitch after processing a few orders. She was unable to submit an order, and saw a negative figure on the platform's main page, she said.Wendy said it was a 'double order' on which they could earn a higher commission. Amanda was instructed to contact customer service and make an upfront payment to cover the negative sum to complete the order.She transferred $180 to a bank account on the first day and $1,000 the next, and was paid about $30 and $200 in commission for those two days.'I did manage to withdraw my money and commission, hence I continued for another day,' she said. On June 20, however, she was required to transfer $42,000 for the 59th order. By then, she had borrowed more than $70,000 from her friends for earlier transactions.The next day, desperate for funds, she contacted a legal moneylender but was told that her salary did not meet the requirement.Deciding to call it quits, she called her bank to reverse her previous transactions. The bank told her that she might be a victim of a scam and she made a police report the same day.Singapore Human Resources Institute president Low Peck Kem said: 'People who fall for the simple work, where they only use their mobile phone and can earn money in their spare time, may find the proposition too attractive to be missed.' The police also advise people not to accept dubious job offers that offer lucrative returns for minimal effort and require them to use their personal bank accounts to perform money transfers for others.Looking back on her ordeal, Amanda said: 'I was too impulsive and wanted to earn quick and easy money. But ultimately there is no easy way out.'One should not give in to these kinds of temptations, especially in this tough period where it may be hard to earn money. No matter how nice it may sound, it is actually too good to be true.'",

Such messages would then urge victims to click on the link provided in the same message if they did not make the transactions.When victims click on the link, they would be led to a phishing website that resembles the official website of a bank, requesting their personal particulars, Internet banking details and one-time passwords (OTPs).'As the scammers had spoofed the bank's SMS accounts, the scammers' message might appear in the same SMS conversation thread as a bona fide SMS message from the bank,' said the police.After providing the details, the victims subsequently realised that they had been scammed after receiving SMSes about money being transferred from their bank accounts, added the police.The police advised members of the public to adopt the following measures to prevent their bank accounts from being compromised:• Do not click on URL links or call the numbers provided in unsolicited text messages.• Always verify the authenticity of the information with the official websites or sources.• Never disclose personal or Internet banking details and OTPs to anyone.

            "Description": "SINGAPORE - The Energy Market Authority (EMA) has flagged false claims made on a website touting a purported power-saving device about electricity consumption here, and urged consumers to consider other ways to save on their power bills.Advertisements for the device, called Voltex, claim that it helps users shave up to 90 per cent off their electricity bills, and have been making the rounds online recently.The product looks like a plug that is inserted into a power socket and is being sold for $74 each, which its website claims is a 50 per cent discount.An advertorial on the site says that 'most Singaporeans are overpaying for electricity by a whopping $27.6 billion dollars per year', citing an unnamed study.It goes on to suggest that the 'Public Utility Commission' has not done anything to address this.EMA told The Straits Times last week that these claims are false.The authority said that an electricity price chart shown on the Voltex website does not correspond with Singapore's electricity prices.'The total value of electricity sold in Singapore is $10 billion a year, so it is not possible for Singaporeans to be overpaying $27.6 billion,' said an EMA spokesman.He added that the Public Utility Commission does not exist here and that the Singapore electricity market is regulated by EMA.The Government's fact-checking website Factually also said in a post on Sunday (June 20) that there are identical pages on the Voltex website customised for people from different countries, such as Australia, Britain and the United States.These other pages bear the same electricity price chart as the one for Singapore, and also sport the same $27.6 billion figure.A check found that one such page replaces mentions of 'Singaporeans' with 'Americans' while keeping much of the text the same.The Factually post calling out 'false and misleading' websites like Voltex's said that many websites that claim to sell so-called power-saving devices, which promise significant savings in electricity bills, 'have turned out to be scams'.'The scammers behind these devices are known to change the names of their devices and websites when their claims are challenged,' said the post.EMA said such devices are also unlikely to work as claimed.The authority advised consumers to instead visit the Energy Efficient Singapore website for energy-saving tips.They can also get safety tips on household electrical products at the Consumer Product Safety Office's website. The Consumers Association of Singapore (Case) said that it has not received any complaints regarding the Voltex device and its purported power-saving benefits.But it advised consumers who want to buy products to cut their power consumption to do their own research to verify the truthfulness of claims made.'As part of their research, they should read authentic, independent and verified reviews and disregard reviews which may not be genuine,' said Case president Melvin Yong.Consumers should also look out for red flags such as misspelt words, as well as use of words and phrases that may sound vague or too good to be true.These warning signs might suggest that the website or an e-commerce platform is not legitimate, said Mr Yong.He also advised consumers to patronise websites or shopping platforms with clear return and exchange policies for defective goods, and a proper way to handle disputes.'They should also note that if they were to purchase from an overseas merchant, it may be difficult for them to seek recourse,' added Mr Yong. For electrical and electronic products, consumers should only buy products with the Safety Mark administered by Enterprise Singapore (ESG).Generally, power-saving devices are not listed as controlled goods that ESG regulates and so would not bear a Safety Mark.Case said that for consumers who want to save on power bills, they could consider buying or using energy-efficient products with the National Environment Agency's Energy Label.",

            "Description": "SINGAPORE - Scammers have come up with a new way to cheat people with a gold bar scheme using compromised WhatsApp accounts, the police warned on Wednesday (June 2).They added that the accounts had been hacked using a voicemail method.In this new scam variant, the crooks pretend to be a friend of a victim by using a hacked WhatsApp account belonging to the friend and then communicating with the victim through the messaging service.Posing as the friend, the scammers tempt the victim into buying gold bars they claim are being sold at 30 per cent below the market rate.The crooks explain that the gold bars are being sold cheaply because they were seized by the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority or Singapore Customs, and were being auctioned off.A fake invoice supposedly issued by Singapore Customs is provided and the scammers instruct the victims to transfer payment for the gold bars to a list of bank accounts.Sometimes, the victims are told to meet the scammers to collect the gold bars.The victims realise they have been duped only when they do not receive the gold bars, or when they find out that their friend's WhatsApp account had been hacked.The police said a scammer can hack into a WhatsApp account by using a voicemail method.The scammer tries to log into a victim's WhatsApp account on his own device, and then deliberately fails the verification process by keying in the wrong six-digit verification codes repeatedly.When the verification fails repeatedly, WhatsApp will prompt the victim to perform a voice verification.It will do this by calling the victim's phone number to provide the verification code in an audio message.If the victim ignores the call or if his phone is not switched on, the audio message is directed to the victim's voicemail account, if he has voicemail enabled.The scammer will then seize this opportunity to access the victim's voicemail account remotely by using the default PIN used by telecoms service providers.This works only if the victim has enabled voicemail and has not changed the default PIN for the voicemail account.After accessing the voicemail account, the scammer can get the six-digit verification code from the audio message in the voicemail and use that to take over the victim's WhatsApp account.Once in control of the account, the scammer can enable a two-step verification process to prevent the victim from regaining control of his WhatsApp account. This new scam variant comes amid a rise in scams here.A total of 15,756 scams were reported in 2020 - a 65.1 per cent jump in cases from the 9,545 reported in 2019.E-commerce scams, which rose by 19.1 per cent last year, were the most commonly reported type of scam last year.The police advised the public to be wary of unusual requests they get over WhatsApp, even if sent by people in their WhatsApp contacts list.Always call friends who presumably sent the requests to verify their authenticity, but do not do so through WhatsApp, as their accounts might be under the control of scammers, said the police.And if prices are too good to be true, they probably are, so buy only from authorised sellers or reputable sources, especially for high-value items. To prevent their WhatsApp accounts from being hacked, the police said that people can enable two-step verification under 'account' in their WhatsApp settings.Members of the public should also contact their telecoms service providers to change their voicemail account's default PIN or to deactivate the voicemail feature.Those with information on scams can call the police hotline on 1800-255-0000, or submit it online at this link.

Besides getting him to pose for the 'X-ray', they also told him to cease all contact with his friends and family.The scammers then told a 33-year-old man here to pass the student a mobile phone and SIM card. The man also booked a hotel room for the student to stay in.It is believed the man, who has been arrested by the police, received $1,000 from the scammers to do so.From the hotel, the student was put in touch with a 61-year-old man here. He was then offered temporary accommodation at the man's home.This man is also being investigated.Preliminary investigations by the police found that both the men were themselves victims of the scam. In the case of the 61-year-old, the scammers had allegedly told him the student was an important witness.After the student had initially stopped contacting his family and friends, his parents in China made a police report on May 16. They received the ransom demand on May 20, but did not pay up.Later that day, the police here found the student safe at the residence of the 61-year-old man. Speaking to the media, the student said he was not harmed throughout the ruse, but wanted to warn other foreign students studying in Singapore to be wary.He said: 'The reason why I believed the scammers was that they had some of my personal information. I've heard some of my friends have had similar experiences, but I never thought it would happen to me.'Last year, close to $40 million was lost here to scammers impersonating officials from China. This was despite there being a slight decrease in the number of cases from 456 in 2019 to 443 last year.In one case, the scammers made off with some $4.2 million. Superintendent of Police Steven Tan, head of anti-scam investigation at the Commercial Affairs Department, advised members of the public to hang up on unsolicited phone calls when in doubt, and to check with the police.He said: 'The China police, Interpol and other overseas law enforcement agencies have no jurisdiction or powers to conduct operations in Singapore. They also have no powers to ask members of the public to help with any form of investigation without the approval of the Singapore Government.'Those convicted of cheating can be jailed for up to 10 years and fined. Those convicted of money laundering can be jailed for up to 10 years and/or fined up to $500,000.The article has been edited for clarity.",

            "Description": "SINGAPORE - Police have uncovered a new scam in which delivery personnel from parcel and food delivery companies are the targets.Under this scam variant, the victims would first receive a cash-on-delivery order via their company's delivery app, the police said in a statement on Tuesday (April 13).On the pretext of making payment for the delivery, the scammer would then ask for the victims' mobile phone number via the app, claiming that it was for the purpose of transferring funds to the victims via PayLah!.The victims would then receive a one-time password (OTP) and be prompted to log in to their PayLah! account and key in the OTP in order to receive delivery payments.Shortly thereafter, the victims would receive a notification that their PayLah! account had been linked to a Google Pay account.Upon reaching the delivery location, the victims would find no one there to receive the item. Subsequently, unknown transactions will be done using the victims' bank accounts.The police advised members of the public to always confirm transactions one is making before keying in the one-time password.They also advised people to inform their banks immediately if their PayLah! accounts were linked to other accounts without their authorisation, and to report any fraudulent transactions to the bank immediately.In a separate statement on Tuesday (April 13), the police also noted an increase in non-banking-related phishing scams involving spoofed e-mails and text messages related to parcel delivery.Victims of such phishing scams would receive spoofed e-mails or text messages purportedly sent from a delivery company such as SingPost or DHL.These phishing e-mails and text messages would usually prompt the victims to check the status of their parcel delivery by clicking on the URL link included in the e-mails and text messages.Upon clicking the URL links, victims would be redirected to fraudulent websites, where they would be required to provide their credit or debit card details and an OTP.In some cases, the victims would receive a notification that their credit or debit cards had been linked to an Apple Pay account.Most of the victims only realised that they had been scammed when they discovered that unauthorised transactions were made using their credit or debit cards, said the police. The police urge members of the public not to click on URL links provided in unsolicited e-mails and text messages, and always verify the authenticity of information received with the official website or sources.They also advise people to contact their card issuing bank immediately if they received an OTP and did not make any online transactions, and to always verify the merchant details indicated in the OTP text message or notification before providing it.The police cautioned against keying in the OTP on the payment page if not making the transaction, and never to disclose personal or Internet banking details and OTPs to anyone.If members of the public have information related to these scams or are in doubt, they can call the police hotline at 1800-255-0000, or submit the info online at the Singapore Police Force's website.For more information on scams, members of the public can visit Scam Alert's website or call the Anti-Scam Hotline at 1800-722-6688.",

Image via Jinghui LeanHuang said, 'I received the call the morning of Oct. 23, 2020 (around 9am). The director [of the company] was very anxious, asking me, 'I have all this information, but what am I supposed to do to recover my money?''Using a spoofed email address, scammers had instructed his staff to transfer money to a bank account, controlled by them.Admin staff had not noticed the incorrect email address at first glance; spoofed email addresses used by scammers often include the slightest of misspellings or replacement of letters.  A 'l' replaces a '1', or a '.' replaces a '-' in spoofed email addresses. Image via SPF websiteIt was only after the director had noted the new bank account and called the supplier to check, had they realised that something was off.Added Huang, 'I told the director to lodge a police report immediately, while officers from the Anti-Scam Centre (ASC) worked concurrently to trace the monies.'Greg Sim, 31, Senior Investigation Officer and Deputy Officer-in-charge of ASC, said, 'It's real-time intervention. The call comes in, sometimes six figures, sometimes S$6,000. We collaborate closely with Stephanie, who acts as the 'contact point', to process the information and act on it meaningfully.''To mitigate these losses, we need to freeze these accounts fast, if not the money will be gone. Recovery of money boils down to luck and speed.'The full sum of S$6,000 was subsequently recovered the same day the scam was reported.39 enquiries a day As the only anti-scam hotline operator situated within ASC, Huang receives, on average, 39 enquiries a day.Over the whole of last year, she answered over 10,000 enquiries, received through email, phone calls, or live chat. Huang, who works closely with Sim on a day-to-day basis. Image via Jinghui LeanHuang, a former Community Policing Officer for three years, says that she first joined ASC in August 2019, to 'make a direct impact' on other's lives.It's not an easy job given that callers are often emotionally frustrated and skeptical of having fallen prey, sometimes even blaming her for getting scammed.One victim, who was retrenched during circuit breaker last year, had called Huang after falling prey to a love scam. While she had initially agreed to follow Huang's advice to validate the scammer's identity, she ended up calling Huang again a few months later, crying and admitting that the guy had broken off communication and she'd lost large sums of money.Said Huang, 'I felt very upset, as I thought I'd spoken to her and she'd realised it was a scam, but that didn't happen. Because it'd been a while since she transferred [the money], I could not help her.'Sim explains that scammers tend to move monies very fast, making chances of recovery lower once time has lapsed or if money has been transferred out of the country.He adds, 'We want the public to understand that scam prevention is also a personal responsibility. If you notice someone who's been using the same account for the past 10 years suddenly request for transferral to a new account, for example, you should do a verification before doing anything.'Highest amount lost in 2020 was S$9.1 million In 2019, 373 cases of BEC scams were reported to Police, resulting in a total loss of S$43.1 million.This increased to 422 reported cases in 2020, resulting in a total loss of S$45.6 million. The highest amount lost was S$9.1 million.To prevent BEC scams, businesses are advised to adopt the following measures:  Be mindful of any new or sudden changes in payment instructions and bank accounts. Always verify payment instructions by calling the e-mail sender using previously known phone numbers, instead of numbers provided in the fraudulent email.  If your business has been affected by this scam, call your bank immediately to recall the funds.  Educate your employees on this scam, especially those that are responsible for making fund transfers, such as purchasing or HR payroll.  Prevent email compromise by using strong passwords, changing them regularly, and enabling Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) where possible.  Install anti-virus, anti-spyware/malware, and firewall on your computer, and keep them updated.

They answered questions on their scam experiences, online practices and perception of scam prevention initiatives, among other things.Six in 10 respondents said they had encountered scams in Singapore an average of 3.17 times a month.Seven per cent of respondents said they had fallen prey to scams in the one-year period. Of these, nearly half were aged between 20 and 39.Ms Whistine Chai, assistant director of the crime, investigation and forensic psychology branch at HTBSC, said: 'Young people are more tech savvy and they spend a lot of time online... They might engage in activities, such as online banking or going through social media, that increase their exposure to scammers.'We also found that young people are likely to be more impulsive and complacent. They (tend) not to stop and think, or check with others before acting.'In its annual crime briefing last week, the Singapore Police Force said the record number of scams reported last year pushed the overall crime rate to its highest since 2009. There were 15,756 reported scams last year, a 65.1 per cent increase from the 9,545 cases in 2019. They made up 42.1 per cent of overall crime last year, up from 27.2 per cent in 2019.The survey found that the majority of scam victims have poor cyber hygiene practices, as they tend to click on pop-up advertisements on websites, or open e-mails from unknown sources.Even though over 80 per cent of victims had seen anti-scam public campaigns before, many of them still had a poor understanding of what safe online practices entail.For instance, 49 per cent of scam victims wrongly believed that the authorities will verify their information by sending them SMS or e-mails with links to click on.Thirty-seven per cent of victims had the false belief that it is common practice to share passwords or OTPs (one-time passwords).Scam victims were also found to lack 'protective factors' such as knowledge of scam tactics, financial literacy and social support from friends and family.",

            "Description": "SINGAPORE - The number of scams reported last year hit a record high, climbing 65.1 per cent from 2019, as scammers took more than $201 million from their victims.The 15,756 reported cases of scams pushed the overall crime rate to its highest since 2009, according to figures released by the police on Tuesday (Feb 9). If scams were excluded, the total number of crimes in 2020 would have decreased by 15.3 per cent to 21,653, from 25,570 in 2019.E-commerce scams, the most commonly reported type of scam last year, saw a 19.1 per cent jump to 3,354 reported cases compared with 2019. The police said on Tuesday that this was partly due to the increase in online transactions amid the Covid-19 pandemic.Deputy Assistant Commissioner Aileen Yap, assistant director of the Commercial Affairs Department's (CAD) Specialised Commercial Crime Division, said the police actively sieve out online monikers, URLs and advertisements from police reports, and send them to online marketplaces to remove these accounts 'so that we disrupt their operation and stop them from carrying out all these scams'.The National Crime Prevention Council (NCPC) launched an app, ScamShield, in November last year to filter out SMSes and phone calls sent and made by scammers. It is available for iPhone users, and an Android version is being developed.CAD director David Chew said that while the authorities have made 'significant inroads in disrupting scammers', the scam numbers continue to rise.Particularly for e-commerce scams, the total amount cheated increased to $6.9 million last year, from $2.3 million in 2019. The largest sum cheated in a single case was $1.9 million.Carousell continued to have the highest portion of e-commerce scams, with 1,319 cases or 39.3 per cent of all reported e-commerce scams.Common scam transactions involved the sales of electronic gadgets, Covid-19-related items and personal accessories.Last year, the Anti-Scam Centre received more than 11,190 reports involving losses of more than $164.6 million. It froze more than 9,015 bank accounts and recovered 35 per cent of the total amount scammed, or about $57.6 million.The authorities said collaboration with key stakeholders, such as banks, fintech companies, telcos and the online marketplace, is key. One online marketplace that takes additional measures to protect shoppers is Lazada, whose verification process involves using algorithms to detect potential scammers.The platform was awarded the Community Partnership Award by the CAD on Monday for stepping up measures to detect fraudulent activity.Its efforts saw the number of reports of scams on its platform fall from 180 in the first half of last year to 32 in the second half.Lazada Singapore chief executive James Chang said: 'It's definitely an ongoing journey. We feel sorry for all the customers impacted and are keeping our best to stay ahead of the curve.' NCPC chairman Gerald Singham said on Tuesday that even as the authorities and marketplaces seek to stop scammers, individual action remains key to preventing scams.'The important thing to know is there is no vaccine for scams. Frankly, the main form of prevention is vigilance by potential victims; you must have your own individual responsibility,' he said.",

            "Description": "SINGAPORE - Planning a staycation at Marina Bay Sands turned into a nightmare for a young couple who were scammed over $277,000 by a Carousell seller, who offered discounted hotel stays in Marina Bay Sands.Ivan and his girlfriend Jessica (not their real names), both in their 20s, were repeatedly assured by the Carousell seller that they would get their money back.The 27-year-old even gave them an address to pick up the $277,000 he took from them in a bag full of cash, but he always cancelled the meetings at the last minute.This was one of the 3,354 police reported e-commerce scams last year, the police announced on Tuesday (Feb 9) when releasing their yearly statistics.Ivan and Jessica, both in their 20s, eventually decided to report him to the police and the scammer was charged in court last month.'We usually go on Carousell for our staycations and we do that quite frequently. And so, when we chanced upon this seller, we went to look at his reviews as usual and saw he was quite reliable,' said Ivan at a media conference held by the police on Monday.The couple paid $29,000 initially for nine hotel suites with three-night stays.However, the Carousell seller made up excuses to siphon more money off them, such as by claiming that they needed to pay cancellation fees even though he did not secure the booking for them.He convinced them to transfer more money to him so that he could purportedly pay off other buyers and have his bank account unfrozen by the authorities.To stop them from going to directly to the hotel, he told them that he booked the rooms under a Paiza membership which does not allow members to sell rooms.He also claimed that he could pay them back, by showing them he had about $230,000 in his bank account.Eventually, the couple gave him more than $277,000 over a four-month period. 'The reason why this amount went up so high is because we were so wrapped up in this situation and we didn't know what else to do, how to get this money back... (and) because he gave us hope that we will get this money back,' said Ivan.The scammer was arrested on Jan 21 and has been charged in court. Carousell vice-president of operations Su Lin Tan told The Straits Times that the e-commerce platform strongly encourages users to use Carousell Protection when transacting on the e-commerce platform. This payment feature holds off payment until a transaction is verified by both buyer and seller. Should there be a dispute or unsuccessful transaction, Carousell can step in to protect users. If the seller fails to fulfil his end of the transaction, the buyer will be fully refunded.'Clamping down on fraud is a never-ending effort and we are constantly innovating to stay ahead of the curve and to keep one step ahead of opportunistic scammers, who evolve almost as quickly as we do,' said Ms Tan.A total of 15,756 scams were reported in 2020 - a 65.1 per cent jump in cases from the 9,545 reported in 2019.E-commerce scams, which rose by 19.1 per cent last year, were the most commonly reported type of scams last year. The total amount cheated in e-commerce scams increased to $6.9 million in 2020, from $2.3 million the year before. The largest sum cheated in a single case in 2020 was $1.9 million.",

            "Description": "Edit: A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that Lin lost S$100,000. The number has been rectified. It started on Facebook.Lin (not his real name), 49, came to befriend a lady called Jasmine in 2020.Lin said in a mix of English and Mandarin:'It started off innocuously. We chatted for at least two weeks before she even started asking questions like if I had a 'side hustle' and whether I'd be keen to invest.' Unbeknownst to Lin, these questions were the spring to a well-oiled trap that would cost him over $50,000, wiping out his life savings.The investment scam Lin fell prey to lasted two months, from December 2020 to January 2021.Building trust Lin, understandably, was almost hoodwinked from the get-go.Despite never meeting in real life and never having heard her voice, Lin thought Jasmine was a good friend. They would chit-chat about their day and talk about everything under the sun.In hindsight, said Lin, Jasmine probably cultivated his trust by being patient and reassuring.It was Jasmine who suggested that Lin first try out a demo investment account free, when he told her that he had no investment experience.She subsequently encouraged him to open a real account, connecting him with her broker.The mysterious broker Jasmine told Lin to download a mobile investment application called MT5.Her broker, Zhou Jie, helped Lin to set up his account. Zhou was also the one who facilitated all of Lin's monetary transfers for the 'investment'.The broker's identity was never verified through video call. Neither did Lin ever hear Zhou's voice.Over text on Line, Lin was told to provide his personal details (including his NRIC number), and remit a sum of money to a designated bank account.On Jan. 1, Lin transferred USD$20,000 (S$26,590) to open a 'standard membership' account. Standard members, he was told, would receive 'trading strategies' which, if followed, would guarantee them a windfall. Lin put in S$20,000 to join as a 'standard member' and gain 'trading strategies'.To 'trade', the broker gave Lin specific, detailed instructions on the stocks to 'buy' or 'sell'.These 'strategies' came in approximately twice weekly.All Lin had to do was press the corresponding buttons in the MT5 app as instructed. The broker would provide 'instructions' to follow in the app, in order to gain a windfall.In hindsight, pressing buttons in an app (which was not available on official platforms, by the way) at the instruction of a person whom you have never seen nor heard would raise some alarm bells.But Lin said that all of his apprehension disappeared when he started seeing his profits grow 'in the thousands'.Feeling confident in his 'successes' and 'ability to trade', Lin did not hesitate when he asked to invest more money. All seemed to be going well, as he pumped in more money and watched as his earnings continued to soar. Some of the 'profit' that Lin made when he was using MT5.Crash and burn That was until two weeks ago.The broker dropped Lin a message, informing him that a trade was going on and asked if he was confident to invest that day. This time, the broker encouraged him to 'buy more since you're confident'.Lin acquiesced.However, within a few minutes of trading, everything changed.The 'lots' that Lin bought took a sudden nosedive.Lin not only lost all the money he'd invested with MT5, but was told that his account had a deficit of US$40,000 (S$53,000).Hounded to repay 'debt' Messages to 'repay the debt' started coming in.The broker told Lin that the matter would be transferred to the 'legal department for processing' if he did not respond.Desperate, Lin said he confided in a few of his friends to borrow the cash needed, but even so, it was tough given the large sum.He also pumped in another S$10,000 that was initially set aside to 'top up' his investment balance, essentially cleaning out his savings.'I was very scared, anxious, and could not eat or sleep,' he said. Lin being hounded by the 'broker' to repay his 'debt'.  Lin being hounded by the 'broker' to repay his 'debt'.Jasmine offered to help as she'd 'gotten him into this', said Lin.She told him that she transferred USD$20,000 to the broker, although Lin never found out if the transaction occurred.Lin said:'I still do not know if she ganged up with the broker, or was sincere in helping me.' The call Then, on Jan. 28, Lin received a call.It was the police, informing him that he had made several transfers to a bank account that was linked to a scam.Lin suddenly connected the dots: He was the victim of a scam â one that was being investigated by the Singapore police.The police informed Lin that their investigation was part of joint island wide 'live intervention' against investment and fake gambling platform scams.Over three days (Jan. 27-Jan. 29), officers from the Anti-Scam Centre (ASC) of the Singapore Police Force investigated and intervened in 200 scam cases by analysing fund flow of scam victims.Officers from the Commercial Affairs Department, Criminal Investigation Department, the seven Police land divisions were joined by major banks including DBS, UOB, OCBC, HSBC and Standard Chartered to conduct the operation. Image via Jinghui Lean Image via Jinghui LeanVanishing act Today, Lin's MT5 account has been wiped clean.He cannot access his profile, nor view his 'investment balance'. He suspects Jasmine might have tipped off the scammers after he let slip that he had made a police report. Lin can no longer access his account on MT5. The scammers might have been tipped off.There is a possibility that he might not be able to get back the money â around S$50,000 â that he had lost. Aside from figures on the screen in the MT5 app, Lin has never seen a single cent of his investment in the flesh:'I thought it [MT5] was a good way to earn some money during Covid-19. Now all the hard-earned money I've saved from over the years is lost. Gone in two to three weeks.' Lin said he has not told his family about the incident, because it was 'not something to be proud of'.76 men and 22 women being investigated for scam involvement According to the Singapore Police, investment scams in S'pore have seen a 126 per cent increase to 1,102 cases, with losses of at least S$69.5 million between 2019 and 2020.In the same period, fake gambling platform scams have increased more than 1,800 per cent to 299 cases, totalling S$15.4 million in losses.Through the three-day operation, the police has identified and is investigating 76 men and 22 women for their suspected involvement in 359 investment scams and fake gambling platform scams.They are suspected to have facilitated the syndicates by opening bank accounts or transferring monies.Under the Remote Gambling Act 2014, any individual found guilty of engaging in using an unauthorised remote gambling service can be fined up to S$5,000, jailed up to six months, or both.This includes victims of fake gambling platform scams, who had opened betting accounts, and placed bets on online betting applications or websites.Under Section 420 of the Penal Code, any individual found guilty of cheating and dishonestly inducing a delivery of propertycan be jailed for up to 10 years and fined.People who open bank accounts to facilitate scams can be found guilty of money laundering under the Corruption, Drug Trafficking and Other Serious Crimes (Confiscation of Benefits) Act. Such individuals can be jailed up to 10 years and fined up to S$500,000.How to avoid scams The police also released some tips to help the public avoid being scammed:  Be wary of strangers on any social media or dating platform.  Always check with a licensed financial advisor before making an investment.  Only deal with companies licensed by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS). You can check if a company is blacklisted by the MAS Investor Alert List.  If an entity is based outside of Singapore, check if it is regulated with the respective overseas authority.  Do not engage in services to place bets on illegal online betting sites or applications.  If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.

            "Description": "SINGAPORE - As invitations roll out by text message for some to receive their Covid-19 vaccinations, scammers are jumping on the bandwagon to dupe other members of the public.Text messages, purportedly from a pharmaceutical company approved to provide the Covid-19 vaccine, have asked recipients to click on a link or make a phone call to schedule appointments for vaccination.The Ministry of Health on Thursday (Jan 7) put up a notice to urge people to be wary of such scams and to verify the authenticity of text messages before offering personal or financial information.'The text messages are not from MOH, and MOH did not approve any pharmaceutical company to contact anyone directly. We urge recipients not to respond to the messages,' the notice said.Ms Grace Chng, who received such a message on Tuesday, did just that.It was from a number she did not recognise but bore the name 'CHUANXIN'.The message, which read, 'Modena, an American pharmaceutical company, has been approved to provide you with Covid-19 vaccine', instructed her to message another number on WhatsApp for registration.'I have come across a number of scam text messages but I was surprised that this one was quite insidious. Unfortunately, these days you have to distrust before you can trust,' said the 65-year-old writer.Singapore has kicked off its nationwide vaccination drive, with Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong among those receiving the jab on Friday.The MOH has started sending out SMS invitations to those who are eligible to register for the vaccination, starting with healthcare workers.Those who receive invitations should check that the link in the SMS ends with '.gov.sg' before clicking on it, said the ministry on its website.They should also not forward messages to others, as each invitation is unique, it added.The MOH has also warned of another scam in which calls or text messages falsely inform recipients that they had been in close proximity to someone who had tested positive for Covid-19. These messages request for personal or financial information in return for a test kit and results.Those who wish to verify the authenticity of such messages, or have more questions on the Covid-19 vaccination exercise can call the MOH hotline on 1800-333-9999.

            "Description": "SINGAPORE - While technology has made faster transfers of money possible, it has also facilitated scammers in carrying out fraudulent transactions.In the first six months of this year, $102 million was lost to various scams.Bank-related phishing scams are of particular concern as the number of cases surged more than 20-fold to 898 in the first half of this year, from just 34 in the same period last year.The total amount lost rose to $3.6 million in the first half of this year, from $93,000 for the same period last year.Both customers and banks have a duty not to facilitate fraud on the customers' bank accounts.The Straits Times spoke to lawyer Steven Lam of Templars Law, banks, the police, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) and the Association of Banks in Singapore, to find out the responsibilities and extent of liabilities of customers and banks.Q. Say I had received a call from a scammer who claimed to be from my telecoms provider and offered to help me resolve my Internet issues. I was tricked into giving him remote access to my laptop and also access to my bank accounts. When I realised that something was amiss, I hung up and immediately reported the incident to the bank. Can the bank stop the funds transfer entered by the scammer?A. Unlikely, because most funds transfers are carried out instantly.Said OCBC Bank's head of group corporate security, Mr Francisco Celio: 'When transactions are authorised by our customers via online banking, though at times fraudulently through scammers, the transactions will be processed almost immediately. Therefore, it is often difficult to stop the transfer. While we will assist our customers to promptly submit a funds recall as soon as OCBC is alerted to the transaction, our ability to recall the funds is dependent on the response of the receiving bank.'Q. If banks cannot suspend the fraudulent transaction, why do I need to alert the bank immediately when I realise that I have been scammed?A. Bank staff can immediately disable your online banking access and cards to prevent scammers from carrying out further fraudulent transactions.Q. If the fraudulent funds transfer is not immediate and takes two to three business days to complete, can my bank stop the transaction?A. Technically, once an instruction is given, the funds will be debited from your account. Even though it has not reached the recipient's bank, it has effectively left yours. The funds could be transferred to an interim bank before reaching the recipient's bank account. It would be difficult to intercept the transaction as the interim bank has an obligation to pass the funds to the recipient's bank.Q. Can the Singapore police help me to recover my funds?A. Yes, if the funds are transferred to a local beneficiary bank account and the funds are still residing within that bank account. Police can issue an order to freeze the beneficiary account to prevent any dissipation of funds. Upon completion of investigations, the police will seek a court order for the funds to be returned to the rightful owner.Q. Can Singapore police help me to recover my funds transferred to an overseas bank?A. The chances of recovery are often slim, even though the police will work with international partners to trace the money.Q. If I report an unauthorised transaction to my bank, when can I expect a resolution?A. Your bank should complete an investigation of any relevant claim within 21 business days for straightforward cases, and up to 45 business days for complex cases. Q. Suppose I had received a call from a scammer who claimed to be a bank employee. He instructed me to log into my bank account and tricked me into making a fund transfer to another bank account. Does my bank have a duty to recover the funds for me?A. The bank's liability will depend on whether the transfer happened as a result of the bank customer's negligence, said lawyer Steven Lam.'In this case, the negligence is on the part of the bank account holder. Contractually, the bank doesn't have to bother. But most banks will still try their best to recover the funds for the account holder.'The MAS said consumers are generally liable for losses from transactions that they had authorised, even if they subsequently find out that they had been tricked into doing so.Q. If my bank account was hacked and my savings were depleted, do I have to bear the losses?A. Yes, if it is ascertained that the primary cause was recklessness on your part, such as failing to protect your access code.But if it is proven that the security breach is on the bank's part, the bank would usually bear the losses, said Mr Lam.Q. What is the bank's duty of care to me?A. A bank's duty of care is contractual in nature. A lot of duty is imposed on the customer.The MAS has issued the E-Payment Guidelines to protect users of electronic payments.The guidelines set out the responsibilities of banks. For instance, banks are expected to provide real-time transaction notifications and a reporting channel, so that you may be alerted to unauthorised transactions and report them should they happen.Bank customers would also need to take reasonable steps to protect their own interests. These include adopting good security practices such as protecting your device, login credentials and access codes.",

Victims lost more than $7.1 million over the same period last year.In a recent variant of the crime, victims were duped by scammers posing as Chinese government 'police' into collecting money from other individuals who turned out to also be victims of the deception.To prove they were credible, fraudsters would e-mail fake court documents to the victims.Scammers using the same ruse have also impersonated staff from courier companies, telecommunication service providers or officers from government organisations.They trick victims by claiming that a mobile number or bank account registered in their name is linked to a crime. They might also say that there are pending court cases against the victims or may ask them to assist in investigations for a criminal offence.Believing that their identities have been stolen, victims would provide personal details, like Internet banking credentials, to be absolved of the purported offence.They would then be told to transfer money and, in some cases, scammers would withdraw funds from the victims' bank accounts.The police said no government agency will ask for banking credentials or to meet strangers to pass or receive money and documents. They advise the public to call a trusted friend or relative before taking action, as they may be overwhelmed by emotion and have poor judgment.To trick victims, scammers may mask their actual phone number and display a local one. Since April 15, all incoming international calls are prefixed with a plus sign.The public should remain vigilant when receiving any unexpected international calls and reject those which spoof local numbers, said the police. They should avoid disclosing any personal information such as their name and passport details.Those with information related to such scams should call the police hotline on 1800-255-0000 or submit it online.

            "Description": "SINGAPORE - It had all the qualities of a fairy-tale romance to Ms Cassandra Tan (not her real name) - meeting an eligible American-Chinese businessman online, and falling in love, with the promise of a 'happy ever after'.But she was just being led down the garden path.Over two years, Ms Tan, a clerk in her 50s, was not only cheated of around $80,000 by her online 'lover', but she had also been manipulated into becoming a money mule for a scammer, laundering $13,500 on his behalf.She first met the man on Facebook in mid-2018. He claimed to be a 59-year-old American Chinese businessman working for 'Keppel', who wanted to come to Singapore to see her.But the man proceeded to spin tall tales regarding his 'business'. He claimed, among other things, that his money had been 'taken by the CIA', and that he and his staff were 'trapped at Customs and needed money to get out'. The man also sent her images of 'himself' lying in hospital, feigning serious medical emergencies.'I started falling in love with him. I also took pity on him and wanted to help,' Ms Tan said.This ruse went on until October 2019, during which she transferred $80,000 of her savings to him in multiple transactions varying from $2,000 to $5,000.But it was not over. The man asked her in May this year to allow him to use her account to purchase bitcoin credits. He made three transfers of $5,000 to her account between May and June, telling her that she could keep $500 per transaction as long as she bought $4,500 bitcoin credits on his behalf.'Every transaction, I kept $500 for my own usage. As he owed me so much money, I thought it is only right for me to keep $1,500 for myself,' Ms Tan said.The Singapore Police Force stepped in when a series of suspicious transfers were detected between Ms Tan's account and other local bank accounts. It later came to light that she had not only been the victim of an Internet love scam, but that she was also being made use of to launder illegally obtained monies.Ms Tan was one of 2,500 people investigated between January and August this year for acting as money mules. Investigations on her case have concluded, and she has been issued an advisory.'When scammers forge relationships with their targets and build trust over time, it becomes easy to get someone to give up their bank information or transfer funds,' said Deputy Superintendent (DSP) Jane Lim from the Commercial Affairs Department. The police have also seen other cases where money mules have landed themselves in hot water for being part of a larger network, sometimes consisting of different layers of money mules who launder the criminal proceeds to make these transactions look legitimate.For instance, 'Nelson', a 26-year-old Singaporean man, was sentenced to 10 months in jail for using his bank account to receive $36,400 between March and April 2017 via 27 bank transfers and cash deposits. He was roped in to being a money mule after procuring sexual services from an unknown woman on online classifieds website Locanto, and subsequently made multiple cash transfers on behalf of a man who he believed was her 'boss'.This was done by converting $34,489.25 into Alipay credits for this 'boss' over 63 transactions. Nelson then kept the balance for his personal use.DSP Lim cautioned against agreeing to receive or transfer any money on behalf of others, especially if the sources of the funds are unknown.'Never share your one-time PIN, or allow anyone to use your bank account, e-wallet, or cryptocurrency account, as you are responsible for all the transactions made through your accounts,' she said.For acting as a money mule to help a criminal retain benefits from illicit activities, one can be fined up to $500,000, jailed for up to 10 years, or both.",

He asked me to install UltraViewer, an application that would give him remote access to my computer, so that he could find out what the problem was,' Lyena said.In a two-hour-long phone conversation, the scammer convinced Lyena that her computer had been hacked by eight people and even furnished photos of these 'hackers'.'He then told me that I had to give him my bank account details so he could protect my bank account from these hackers, which I stupidly did,' she said.Lyena received a call from her bank the next morning informing her that $35,000 had been transferred out of her account into another bank account.It was only then she realised that she had been scammed, and she made a police report immediately. Lyena said she is grateful that the police conducted their investigations swiftly and were able to recover $33,000 within three days and the remaining $2,000 soon after.'I would never have thought that I would become a victim of a scam and it was a really traumatic experience. I've since installed anti-virus software in both my phone and computer,' she said. Mr Alan Kit, senior investigation officer at the Commercial Affairs Department, said the police immediately contacted the banks to freeze the accounts when Lyena filed the report.'We got hold of the particulars of the beneficiary who had received $35,000 from Lyena's bank account. My colleague and I went down to his address immediately and were able to recover $33,000 in cash,' Mr Kit said.The remaining $2,000 had been frozen in the beneficiary's bank account and the police obtained a court order to return the money to Lyena.Mr Kit added that the scammers had contacted the beneficiary, who is a businessman, and gave the excuse of buying surgical gloves from him to deposit $35,000 into his account.The beneficiary had withdrawn $33,000 to pay his glove supplier and had no idea that the money was from the victim of a scam.In the first half of this year, there were 317 cases of tech support scams reported to the police, more than 10 times the 30 cases in the same period last year.Victims lost a total of $15 million, up from $340,000 in the same period last year. It is the second-largest amount cheated from victims, the first being investment scams at $22.3 million.The largest amount cheated in a single case in the first six months of this year was $958,000.Mr Kit said scammers impersonating tech support staff are on the rise now that many people are working from home.He advised the public not to follow instructions to install applications, type commands into the computer or log in to online banking accounts.'All incoming international calls are prefixed with a plus sign and the public should be wary when receiving unsolicited calls from overseas,' he said.",

            "Description": "SINGAPORE - Scepticism and a wariness of deals that are too good to be true are the first line of defence against getting scammed, said Mr Gerald Singham, chairman of the National Crime Prevention Council (NCPC).The number of scam cases reported in the first half of 2020 was 7,253 in the 10 main categories of scams - over 4,200 more than the 3,027 cases reported in the same period last year.This makes constant vigilance all the more important now as scammers have developed creative ways of going about their nefarious activities: by using technology to mask their numbers, or by employing new methods to filter through scores of potential victims in search of an ideal target.Mr Singham highlighted the need for a healthy dose of scepticism and vigilance, particularly when receiving dubious phone calls or messages.'There is no vaccine against scams. The best way to inoculate ourselves against them is to be vigilant, to be watchful, and to spot the signs,' he said.To this end, the Singapore Police Force and the NCPC are rolling out the sixth edition of their annual anti-scam campaign: 'Spot the signs. Stop the crimes.'The campaign will run from August to March 2021, with a focus on sharing real scam examples with the public to educate people on how to spot the various telltale signs of scams - from impersonation scams to credit-for-sex scams.The launch follows the release of statistics on Wednesday (Aug 26) that indicated a sharp 139 per cent year-on-year rise in cases in the 10 main categories of scams for the first six months of this year.E-commerce scams, social media impersonation ruses, loan scams and banking-related scams topped the list of common scams, with surges in the number of cases in each of these categories. The amount lost in the 10 most common types of scams also doubled to $82 million, up from the $41.6 million that scammers made off with in the first six months of 2019. Mr Singham encouraged members of the public to not only stop and think before revealing personal details or handing over one-time passwords, but to also take the extra step of verifying information with a third party or the authorities.'If someone approaches you for personal information or asks for banking details, it must raise suspicion. The onus must be on us - the potential victim - to stop the crimes from happening and cut off communication before any important information can be divulged.' People should be all the more vigilant as scammers might create fake profiles to assume the identities of an old friend or family member, to get one to unwittingly part with cash.In the instance of John (not his real name), 20, a scammer made off with around $1,400 from his bank account this July after duping him into handing over three Shopee one-time verification codes.The scammer posed as John's secondary school friend from Malaysia - whom he had not spoken to for two to three years - by duplicating her Instagram profile and chatting him up. The scammer claimed that in order to join a lucrative contest on Shopee, John had to give the scammer several six-digit codes to his Shopee account that had been sent to his phone.'I didn't even think about it and didn't ask for verification before sending over the one-time pins because I thought it was my friend. It was only after I saw to my shock that the money was gone from my bank that I thought to check if it was really her,' John said.",

This is up from 466 cases in the first three months.This means the number of cases more than doubled in two months.Victims were cheated of at least $2.2 million from January to May, more than double the $1 million lost from January to March.In most of the cases, victims were tricked into disclosing their credit card information and one-time passwords to scammers, the police said.Scammers would often use compromised or spoofed social media accounts on Facebook or Instagram, where they posed as friends or followers of the victims they targeted.They would then ask victims for their personal details such as mobile numbers or their Internet banking account details, claiming they would sign these victims up for contests or promotions on online shopping platforms Lazada or Shopee.Victims later discovered that unauthorised fraudulent transactions - often on online platforms selling virtual currency for online games - had been made from their bank accounts and mobile wallets without their consent.The police advised the public to be wary of unexpected requests or offers from social media contacts, especially those related to lucky draws or contests.'Verify whether the account is legitimate by checking with your family and friends offline,' the police said.

Offenders can be fined up to $125,000, jailed for up to three years, or both.The police warned those looking for jobs to be wary of advertisements that promise the convenience of working from home and pay high salaries for easy responsibilities.Legitimate businesses will also not need the job seekers to use their own bank accounts to receive money on the businesses' behalf, the police said, adding that these are common ruses used by scammers to make others help them carry out illicit payment services on their behalf.To avoid becoming involved in money laundering, the public should always reject requests by others to use their bank accounts.For more information on scams, visit the website or call the anti-scam hotline on 1800-722-6688.

Mr Rozhnov said the fraudsters chose known and trusted companies and brands.'We have seen more than 10 Singaporean brands actively exploited by the fraudsters in the Rabbit Hole scheme.'It's hard to tell how many people actually submitted their personal information, but we've discovered close to 100 fraudulent resources tailored for Singaporeans.' Just on Thursday (May 28), McDonald's issued a statement regarding a link being shared with a fake promotion, and urged customers not to fall for the ruse.Mr Lars Voedisch, managing director of PRecious Communications, said it would be wise for brands to monitor such scams and issue clarifications.He said: 'If you're a brand and believe the impact is big enough, you should be coming out to clarify with a statement.'The scam is not your fault, and you can't control it, but it's about the perception and what your brand becomes associated with.'He added that from a public relations viewpoint, how brands respond would affect how they are seen.He said: 'If well-managed, the brand's personality then grows. But if they ignore or just brush it aside, they may be perceived as arrogant, damaging their image further.'",

Please comply with safe distancing measures, including no gatherings with family or friends who do not live together,' the police said in a Facebook post.This is not the first time that the police have had to dismiss such a claim.On April 14, the police said they did not actively check homes for people breaking circuit breaker rules, but would take action if they came across such cases in the course of dealing with other complaints.The police statement in April referred to circulating text messages that suggested that they were going door to door to arrest those who had invited people not living with them to their homes.'This is not true. The police urge the public not to spread unsubstantiated information which may cause public alarm,' the police said in the statement last month.",

            "Description": "SINGAPORE - The number of Internet love scams increased in the first three months of the year although the total amount of money stolen fell.There were 175 cases recorded between Jan 1 and March 31, up 33.6 per cent from 131 in the same period last year.However, the rip-offs totalled about $6.6 million, down from $7.1 million or so, the police noted on Wednesday (May 20).Social media sites Facebook and Instagram were again the two most common platforms where victims were approached.Scammers typically befriend people on social media sites and develop relationships despite never meeting face to face.They also claim to have sent parcels of luxury items or large sums of money to the victims from abroad but that these parcels were detained by the authorities. Scammers then ask the victims to make payments on their behalf in order to secure the release of the items.They also enlist an accomplice claiming to be a staff member of a courier company or government agency who tells the victim that the parcels have been detained for inspection.Victims are tricked into transferring money to local or foreign bank accounts and some are also threatened with prosecution if they fail to send the funds.In other cases, the scammers ask for money to be transferred electronically from the victims to help them overcome financial hardship. Such requests often take place several times, with the amounts being requested starting small and progressively increasing as the scammers continue to build trust with the victims.Victims eventually realise that they have been ripped off when the scammers become uncontactable, but by that time, large amounts of money would have already been transferred.The police urged the public to be careful when befriending strangers online and be wary if asked to send money to someone they do not know.They should also immediately stop communicating with anyone who contacts them and asks for payments to a bank account in relation to government fines or charges.Anyone with information on scams can contact the police on 1800-255-0000 or on the I-Witness website.",

            "Description": "Many people have turned to online shopping during this circuit breaker period as they dutifully stay at home.In response, some scammers are taking this opportunity to prey on shoppers using sophisticated methods.Recently, some people in Singapore have received fake SingPost delivery text messages to notify them about the delivery status of their purchase.These links are likely to be phishing scams under the guise of a SingPost delivery tracking page.According to one Facebook user, Thomas TangMushi, the message 'looks so real' that you might fall for it if you were indeed waiting for deliveries to arrive.Here's how it looks: via Thomas TangMushi/Facebook.The link in the text message will direct you to a fake delivery tracking webpage that has the SingPost logo at the top.The potential victim is then informed that the delivery has been put on hold due to outstanding payment.The payment indicated on the page varies, but it is usually a small amount such as S$3, S$1.67, or S$2.95. via Thomas TangMushi/Facebook.Here's another example of how the page might look like after you click into the link in the text message: Image by Jeanette Tan.Then you will be directed to another page where you'll have to enter your name, address, phone number, and credit card details. via Thomas TangMushi/Facebook. via Thomas TangMushi/Facebook.But eagle-eyed consumers will sense something is amiss from the website URL such as 'collection.juststickitin.com' and 'signup.yogasuma.care'.Phishing scams These fake messages are phishing attempts, SingPost confirmed with Mothership.Phishing is an attempt to obtain sensitive information, such as names, passwords, and credit card details from the victim.The scammers usually disguise themselves as well-known or trustworthy corporations over electronic communications.According to SingPost spokesperson, Robin Goh, SingPost is aware of this particular phishing scam that has been designed to imitate the SingPost website, with text messages asking for personal data to claim an undelivered parcel.'It is most unfortunate that scammers are taking advantage of the Covid-19 global pandemic to feed on the vulnerable during these uncertain times,' Goh said.SingPost has also informed the authorities and 'immediate crackdown measures' have been enacted.SingPost does not delay delivery due to outstanding payments According to Goh, SingPost does not ask for outstanding payments via text messages or stall the deliveries because of that.'SingPost does not ask for outstanding payment via text messages as âransomâ before parcel delivery, as the scam messages currently demand.' In the event of any outstanding charges or payment, SingPost will only collect the payment at the point of delivery or collection of the parcel.Tips on how to identify phishing scams SingPost has warned users of such phishing attempts which can be in the form of email or websites seeking users' personal, financial or other sensitive information on their website.They have also shared some tips on how to identify a phishing scam:  A phishing email tends to address you generally as 'Dear Sir/Madam'. It tends to also urge you to act quickly or with threats.  Beware also of pop-ups. Do not click on hyperlinks, download files or open attachments unless you are sure that the source is legitimate.  Beware of text messages asking you to claim a prize or to do a survey by following a hyperlink  Look out for any security warnings displayed by web browsers and any security software. If there is a security warning, it is best to follow it.  If you have responded to any of these fake SingPost messages or emails, you are advised to lodge a police report, change your passwords on all online accounts and to contact your banks to stop any transactions.If you are unsure of the authenticity of the message or email you've received purportedly from SingPost, you can call SingPost hotline 1605 for verification.Top image via Thomas TangMushi/Facebook",

            "Description": "SINGAPORE - E-commerce scams proved to be the most common in the first three months of this year, with 'Covid-19 related items' accounting for about one in four such cases.Fake loan schemes were another common tactic as scammers got away with at least $41.3 million in total between January and March this year.The total amount lost has grown by 27.9 per cent compared with the figure in the same period last year, the police disclosed in a media release on Monday (May 4).Police said that fraudulent sellers duped 1,159 victims out of at least $1.3 million in e-commerce scams in the first quarter of this year. The largest amount lost in a single case was $175,000.'The merchandise involved in such scams included Covid-19-related products such as face masks, and electronic products such as game consoles and phones,' said the police.E-commerce scams involving electronic products were of particular concern, with more than 530 victims losing at least $380,000 to fraudulent sellers.The second most common scam type was social media impersonation, said the police, with 466 reports of such scams filed in the first quarter of the year, a more than 10-fold increase from the 33 cases reported last year in the same period.In such instances, scammers used compromised or spoofed social media accounts to ask for personal details like Internet banking account details, mobile numbers or one-time passwords (OTP).Fraudsters got away with at least $1 million by making fraudulent transactions from their victims' bank accounts and mobile wallets. The largest sum cheated in a single case was $302,000, said the police.Loan scams have also continued to grow in popularity, with cases increasing by about 50 per cent to 421 from January to March this year, up from 281 in the same period last year. Victims were cheated of at least $1.6 million through such fake loan schemes, and the largest amount cheated in a single case was $92,000.The police also highlighted a loan scam tactic targeting bank customers, where victims received advertisements from 'banks' like DBS, POSB, UOB and CIMB offering loans. Banks and licensed moneylenders are not allowed to send out such loan advertisements, said the police.In the same release, the police also warned of the rise of bank phishing scams and Internet love scams.The latest numbers show that scammers cheated 374 victims out of at least $1.6 million between January and March by posing as bank staff and tricking them into revealing their Internet banking details.This is a sharp increase from the 30 cases reported last year in the same period, which cost victims some $69,000 in total.Online 'Romeos' have also stepped up their efforts this year, with 175 victims losing some $6.6 million to their Internet partners in the first three months of the year.This is up from the 131 cases reported last year in the same period, which saw victims losing some $7.1 million. The police warned the public not to divulge personal information to others, and to pay for items only after they have received it.Most of the cases involved overseas scammers but 751 people in Singapore were investigated in connection with them, police said.'The majority of scams are perpetrated from overseas, and it is nearly impossible to recover monies once they are transferred out of Singapore,' added the police.",

The victims were then instructed to either make advance payments via AliPay credits at AXS machines or buy iTunes or Google Play gift cards and send over the redemption codes in exchange for the sexual services.The scammers then became uncontactable after the advance payments were made.In the first three months of the year, the police received 237 reports of credit-for-sex scams, with more than $613,000 cheated. The number of cases reported increased by 40.2 per cent and the total amount cheated increased by more than $211,000 when compared with the same period in 2019.The police advised the public to be wary of friend requests or online listings offering escort, massage or sexual services as they may be fraudulent in nature. Police said scammers may employ scare tactics to threaten victims into making more payments. They urged the public not to accede to the scammers' demands or give out personal details such as their credit card information.They added that people should take the circuit breaker measures seriously, and avoid going out during this period.Those in doubt or have information related to credit-for-sex crimes can call the police hotline on 1800-255-0000, or visit this website.

MAS officers will never ask members of the public for personal banking information (or) online banking log-in credentials such as usernames, passwords and one-time PIN(s),' the authority said.The Association of Banks in Singapore (ABS) also noted a recent uptick in scam messages and calls that impersonate bank staff which sometimes falsely offer bank loans.It said it will not make calls to customers from an international phone number, or unsolicited ones via mobile chat apps like Whatsapp or Viber.If members of the public receive calls from their banker via Whatsapp, it would only be to resolve or follow up on specific matters that they are fully aware of, the ABS said.Banks will also not close accounts within a few hours, and will not ask for PINs and one-time passwords.Those who receive such calls can report the incident to their bank and to the MAS by e-mailing webmaster@mas.gov.sg, or call the police on 1800-255-0000.

            "Description": "SINGAPORE - Members of the public should stay vigilant and be wary of those who impersonate enforcement officers ensuring compliance with elevated safe distancing measures, the Ministry of the Environment and Water Resources (MEWR) said on Wednesday (April 15).From Thursday, such enforcement officers and safe distancing ambassadors can also be identified through red passes that they will carry with them, MEWR added.Enforcement officers may also wear a red armband. This is on top of existing identifiers including their agencies' corporate attire, staff pass and/or lanyard, or the SG Clean Ambassador pass.'These new identifiers will help the public to better identify enforcement officers and ambassadors,' said MEWR, adding that members of the public should always request the officer's identification to verify his or her identity before complying with the instructions of the officer.Besides police officers, enforcement officers are the only officers who can take enforcement action by issuing composition fines against the public for breaches of safe distancing measures, while ambassadors help to guide businesses and individuals to comply with safe distancing measures.Enforcement officers are not allowed and would never ask members of the public to pay fines on the spot, MEWR stressed, adding: 'Members of the public are cautioned against handing over any cash or providing their bank account details to persons who claim to be enforcement officers.'Anyone found to have impersonated an enforcement officer will be subjected to police investigations. Those convicted of cheating by personation could be jailed up to five years and fined. Those convicted of personating a public servant also face a jail term of up to two years and a fine.MEWR also highlighted the issue of enforcement officers, as well as SG Clean and safe distancing officers, being abused.Minister for the Environment and Water Resources Masagos Zulkifli said in a Facebook post on Wednesday that he was upset to learn of criminal force being used against a number of officers on the frontline. '(On Wednesday), an enforcement officer was slapped by a man who did not comply with safe distancing measures, and a safe distancing ambassador was punched by an errant member of the public when advised to wear his mask properly,' he said. 'Let me state categorically that such behaviour is unacceptable. We will be taking action against these individuals and will not hesitate to do the same should there be other similar incidents.'Cases of physical or verbal abuse will be reported to the police for follow-up, MEWR said, and these cases will be considered separately from the principal offence that the Government will be charging the offender for. Giving an update on enforcement efforts since the circuit breaker period kicked in on April 7, MEWR said that 3,000 enforcement officers, SG Clean and safe distancing ambassadors have been deployed daily to public spaces in Housing Board estates across Singapore to ensure elevated safe distancing measures are observed.They come from almost 50 public agencies and include non-public servants recruited from the hospitality and aviation sectors, as well as volunteers recruited by the People's Association and other government agencies.It is now mandatory for everyone to wear a mask when leaving their homes. From Thursday, those who do not wear masks in public will face a fine of $300 for the first offence, and $1,000 for the second offence. Egregious cases will also face prosecution in court. Such penalties are similar to breaches of other safe distancing measures.",

            "Description": "[UPDATED on Monday, Feb. 17 at 10:15am] A Mothership reader who had spent approximately S$420 on 10 boxes of masks from MedicalLex received an update from the company that her order has been cancelled. She shared with us this email that they sent:  The email claimed that the cancellation was due to 'an unexpected delay of shipment which has heavily affected our delivery time'. The Mothership reader alerted us this morning that she received a full refund from the company. At the time of writing this update, the MedicalLex Facebook page is no longer available, although the website appears to still be functional. [End of update.] Many in Singapore have been responding to the coronavirus situation in a less-than-calm way, as seen in the mass panic-buying of masks and food.And there have been a fair share of individuals and businesses taking advantage of the public panic, reselling masks and exorbitant prices.One such business that has been accused of scamming consumers is MedicalLex, which sells disposable face masks.You may have seen their ads floating around Facebook over the past week or so. A first glance at MedicalLex WhenÂ Mothership first visited MedicalLex's website on Feb. 10, we found that users must first wait 'in line', before being given 10 minutes on the website. Image screen captured from medicallex.com.There were apparently 176 people ahead of us, and we had a wait time of one minute.After about two minutes, during which the little walking person graphic moved across the screen, we were directed to MedicalLex's homepage.The website queue now appears to have been removed, and visiting the webpage brings you directly to the home page.A quick look at MedicalLex's website shows a legitimate-looking design with clean graphics, decent grammar, and glowing reviews. Image screen captured from medicallex.com. Image screen captured from medicallex.com. Image screen captured from medicallex.com.The website sells one product: boxes of disposable surgical masks that come in packs of 10, with five packs per box for 50 masks per box. Image screen captured from medicallex.com.Each box of 50 is selling at US$28.99 (S$40.20), although the currency in which customers are charged is not immediately obvious until checkout.The address on the website footer locates it in Arizona, U.S. Image screen captured from medicallex.com.According to the website, the masks are produced in Canada, Philippines, Indonesia, Thailand, 'etc', and even includes an additional note directly stating that their masks are not made in or shipped from China: Image screen captured from medicallex.com.Here are the countries it ships from. Cool.However, a closer look at the website shows some apparent inconsistencies.Tens of thousands of customers in one week MedicalLex claims on its homepage to have served 70,000 'happy customers'. Image screen captured from medicallex.com.The information in the website's footer shows a slight discrepancy of 68,500+ customers. Image screen captured from medicallex.com.However, according to a Whois lookup, the website's domain was only created on Feb. 4, 2020. Image screen captured from medicallex.com.Similarly, the brand's Facebook page was only set up on February 5, 2020. Image via Facebook / MedicalLex.According to MedicalLex's FAQs, it normally takes one to two business days to process the orders, and then another one to two weeks to be delivered, depending on customers' locations and selected shipping options.There is, however, the option to opt for express shipping, which allegedly takes two to five working days and costs US$29.56 (S$40.98), more than a box of masks. Image screen captured from medicallex.com.In addition, MedicalLex has a number of notices on its website to encourage customers to buy quickly, by claiming low supply and high demand.For example, these messages appear at the top of the checkout screen:    Fake reviews In addition, the website claims to boast more than 750 glowing reviews by happy customers.However, only 20 of the 759 reviews appear to load.In addition, the images and comments of the 'customers' who supposedly wrote the reviews appear on other websites and social media platforms.For example, 'Michel' had this to say about MedicalLex masks:'I got exactly what I ordered as described by the seller. quality is very good and light comfortable to wear. there is no unpleasant odour they remain fairly cool and easily breathable to wear during use.I purchased 50 masks which came in 5 clear bags of ten great to keep clean dust free until required.'  Image screen captured from medicallex.com.Her review, however, matches word-for-word the review that Amazon user Tanya left on this product on May 10, 2019: Image screen captured from Amazon.Similarly, the review by 'Todd K.' for MedicalLex reads exactly like another Amazon customer's review, which was posted on Feb. 10, 2017. Image screen captured from medicallex.com. Image screen captured from Amazon.A reverse image search of 'Michel' shows that the image appears to have been posted under multiple hashtags meaning 'mask' or 'face mask' in German, Spanish, and Italian. 'Mike' raved about the quality of the masks' fabric and lamented that he wasn't able to buy more masks due to the website's restrictions. Image screen captured from medicallex.com.'Mike' also appeared as a sample image in this tutorial about how to sharpen portraits on Photoshop.And 'Jennifer' from Atlanta, Georgia in the U.S., who said that MedicalLex is her 'favorite', appeared in a stock photo taken in Spain.  Skeptical Facebook users Some netizens have taken to Facebook to share their experiences with MedicalLex.One Welyn Cat posted on Facebook group SG Blacklists Profiteering Retailers about a discrepancy in replies by MedicalLex to two different Facebook commenters.Replying to one Facebook user, Bryanne Yang, MedicalLex confirmed that there are 50 masks per box. However, replying a comment by one ManNÃ¨Ã¨ Ow, the page affirmed that there are 250 masks in one box. Image via Facebook / Welyn Cat.Welyn Cat's post also included screenshots of multiple other commenters complaining about paying large amounts of money and urging one another to call their respective banks. Image via Facebook / Welyn Cat. Image via Facebook / Welyn Cat. Image via Facebook / Welyn Cat.However, those comments don't seem to be under MedicalLex's Facebook post from February 6.While Facebook shows that there should 122 comments on the post, the majority of them are unable to be viewed. Image via Facebook / MedicalLex.A Mothership reader told us that she tried to comment on the posts on MedicalLex's Facebook page to 'inform everyone that it's a scam' but claimed to eventually have been blocked.One of the few comments of a positive nature on MedicalLex's Facebook page is by one Serena Scott. Image via Facebook / MedicalLex.However, a closer look at Serena Scott's profile shows that she has only one Facebook friend.In addition, her Facebook URL has a distinctly different name from 'Serena Scott' - Zahra Shirafkan. A number of people have bought from the website A number of people in both Malaysia and Singapore have made purchases from MedicalLex.Malaysian Chinese-language newspaper Sinchew Daily reported that the Commercial Crime Investigation Department of Bukit Aman has received 25 reports so far, and that preliminary estimations of the amount spent total to RM460,000 (S$154,365).AnotherÂ Mothership reader informed us that she and 10 of her 'close contacts' made purchases on the website.She claims to have spent around S$420 on surgical masks from the website, as MedicalLex caps the number of boxes that any one individual can purchase to 10.She said that the 10 people she knows that also purchased from the website spent similar amounts of money.MedicalLex responds In an update posted on Feb. 10, MedicalLex claimed that a batch of 100,000 masks had been packaged and shipped from Germany and Ukraine to their warehouse and is expected to arrive on Feb. 18.They also addressed people's claims that they had not yet received their orders, saying that no orders are delayed, but are yet to be dispatched.The company also threatened legal action against those who 'defame' the brand without proof, and shared photos to further prove their legitimacy, such as of a quality service certificate and a box of masks, both with details blurred out.However, Facebook user çæ pointed out in a post that the certificate which MedicalLex claims is theirs matches exactly with the quality service certificate of German trading company AMPri, which has been operating for 25 years, according to their Facebook page.Here are the two certificates: Image via Facebook / MedicalLex. Image via ampri.de.All of the dates on the certificates are exactly the same, and the MedicalLex certificate appears to have blurred out the information where the other certificate shows that it belongs to AMPri.More importantly, even the signature of the certificate that MedicalLex claims is theirs matches the signature on the AMPri certificate.The box of masks that MedicalLex posted also appears on the AMPri website: Image via Facebook / MedicalLex. Image screen captured from ampri.de.In another update posted on Feb. 11, MedicalLex once again gave an update on the order situation and gave another warning about legal actions for people speaking against them:'Please understand that we are fully aware of the recent circulations going round in Singapore and Malaysia to discredit our brand, MedicalLexâ¢. While this is a sorry development, kindly be advised that we are on top of the situation and have contacted our legal team to consider suing for defamation of character.' They also said that those who want to cancel their order can do so by emailing them so that they can issue a 'special cancellation' so that the order can be given to 'those in dire need who appreciate our efforts during this time of crisis'.This post included a collage of photos, including an invoice for 50 cartons of face masks.While the information on the invoice appears to be blurred out, it is still possible to make out the words 'Agemac Supply & Trading Co. Ltd'. Image via Facebook / MedicalLex.The company by that name appears to be a computer company in Nigeria. Image screen captured from manufacturerss.com.Nigeria is not one of the countries that MedicalLex has mentioned they work with.Mothership has reached out to the Ministry of Trade and Industry and the police for a statement.

            "Description": "SINGAPORE - Scammers took more than $160 million from their victims last year, marking a 50 per cent surge in such cases and pushing the overall crime rate to its highest in nine years.Figures released by the police on Wednesday (Feb 5) showed that the total number of reported crimes increased by 6.3 per cent, from 33,126 cases in 2018 to 35,209 cases last year.Since 2011, the overall crime rate has been trending downwards from 608 cases per 100,000 people to 587 cases per 100,000 people in 2018.However, last year, the overall crime rate spiked to 617 cases per 100,000 people.Of the total number of reported crimes, about one in four related to scams, which saw an increase of 53.5 per cent from 6,189 cases in 2018 to 9,502 cases last year.More money was also lost to scammers last year, with the total amount hitting $168.1 million - a 16 per cent increase from the previous year at $144.9 million. This is the highest amount lost in a year since 2016, according to police figures.The police noted that if scam cases were excluded, the total number of reported crimes would have decreased by 4.7 per cent, from 26,937 cases in 2018 to 25,707 cases last year.This was due to a significant fall in four out of the six crime categories that account for the overall crime rate. The four are crimes against persons; violent or serious property crimes; housebreaking and related crimes; and theft and related crimes.In the four categories, police figures showed that motor vehicle and related thefts, robbery, as well as snatch theft cases, registered a 35-year low last year.Motor vehicle and related thefts fell by 24.1 per cent to 665 cases, compared with 876 cases the previous year. Meanwhile, robbery decreased by 22.2 per cent to 56 cases last year, from 72 cases in 2018.Snatch theft fell by 29.2 per cent to 34 cases from 48 cases in the previous year. There was also an increase in crime-free days compared with the previous year. Last year, there were 179 days free from snatch theft, robbery and housebreaking - an increase of 16 days compared with 2018.However, the number of reported scams saw a spike last year.E-commerce scams, loan scams and credit-for-sex scams made up more than 60 per cent of the top 10 scam types last year. The number of reported cases for these three types of scams also increased by 54.2 per cent last year, compared to the previous year.About 45 per cent of e-commerce scams took place on online marketplace Carousell, a drop compared with 70 per cent the previous year.But more e-commerce scams took place on other digital platforms, including Facebook, Instagram, Shopee and Lazada, as compared with the previous year.Common transactions in these cases involved the sales of electronic products and tickets to events and attractions such as Universal Studios Singapore, said the police.For credit-for-sex scams, common platforms used for money transfers were Alipay and iTunes cards, said the police.To fight the scourge of scams, the police set up an Anti-Scam Centre last June under the Commercial Affairs Department (CAD) to disrupt scammers' operations and mitigating monetary losses.So far, 3,312 reports involving total losses of $10.6 million have been referred to the centre, allowing it to freeze 2,600 bank accounts to recover 35 per cent of the amount scammed or $3.7 million, said the police.The centre has been working closely with the three major local banks - DBS, UOB and OCBC - since its formation to freeze bank accounts suspected to be involved in scammers' operations.Last November, it roped in seven more banks to join the initiative. They are ANZ, CIMB, Citibank, Standard Chartered, Bank of China, HSBC and Maybank. The centre has also worked with the Association of Banks in Singapore to shorten the time for banks to provide PayNow transaction details to the police, from weeks to a few days. This increases the chances of recovery of money scammed from victims, said the police.Director of CAD David Chew said many scammers take advantage of the anonymity of the Internet and social media to threaten and target unsuspecting victims.'Many of these scams originate from foreign jurisdictions and we see a lot of the victims' monies leaving Singapore. The police will continue to collaborate with our foreign counterparts to pursue the scammers and the monies,' he added.While the police will continue to educate the public on crime prevention measures, the public must also play their part, said Mr Chew.'They should be aware of the latest scam tactics and always exercise vigilance to protect themselves, their friends and families from falling victim to scams.'",

            "Description": "SINGAPORE (STOMP) - The police are investigating an incident in which a 60-year-old woman had her life savings of $55,000 wiped out from her bank account after falling victim to a scam that was carried out through messaging platform Viber.In a post on Tuesday (Jan 14), Facebook user Labina Fariah outlined how her mother, who is a widow, was duped by the scammer.Calling for netizens not to judge her mother, Ms Labina said she decided to share details of the incident to warn others so they would not have to go through the same ordeal.She wrote: 'This should be a warning to all of us who have parents, no matter how educated they might be, they can be lost in their own space too.'According to Ms Labina, someone had called her mother on Viber and claimed to be from DBS Bank on Monday afternoon.The caller told her mother that 'he was going to check on her account as he noticed that the account was being hacked'.Despite having some doubts and asking why the call was made via Viber instead of a local number, Ms Labina's mother 'fell for his words' and provided the caller with her bank card number and iBanking PIN.'My mother's entire life saving were wiped out just with one single OTP (one-time password) and she was only left with $99,' wrote Ms Labina.Her mother sensed that something was amiss when she received an e-mail notifying her about a transfer of $17,999.05.Panic-stricken, she called Ms Labina, who told her to go update her bank book.The scammer was still on the phone at that point in time. 'After wiping out $54,999.06 from a widow, he still wanted more,' Ms Labina said.'That was when I realised (my mother) was just left with $99. She broke down and I am not sure how to make things right for her.'A police report was made on the same day.The police confirmed with Stomp that a report was lodged and investigations are being carried out.Ms Labina said that when her mother broke down, it 'felt as if I was punched in my gut'.'To many of us, the amount is small but my friends, that was my mother's life savings. It was all taken away from her within 30 minutes,' she said.'I wish I were a better daughter who could walk up to her and tell her, screw it, I will just give it to you. I feel rotten.'Ms Labina questioned how the huge transaction was allowed to go through despite its dubious nature. She also sought advice about blocking such transactions and retrieving the money.When contacted about the case by Stomp, DBS Bank said it wanted to remind customers to always be vigilant and never give out their personal security information, enter sensitive information into unknown websites, click on URL links originating from unknown sources, or reply to unsolicited SMSes, e-mails or calls.'Please note that DBS/POSB will never request for our customers to download software, disclose their Internet Banking access credentials (such as username or password, OTP, Digital Token approval), or to conduct any fund transfers over the phone,' the bank said. Customers can contact the bank on its 24-hour hotline on 1800-111-1111 if they notice suspicious or unusual activity in their accounts.'Scammers are actively targeting bank customers in Singapore via automated calls, voice calls and SMSes, phishing for bank account and personal information that could lead to loss of money,' said DBS Bank.'To raise awareness, DBS has created a short video clip detailing the recent scam tactics and what customers should be aware of.'Ms Labina told Stomp that she was in the process of speaking with DBS Bank about the matter.She added: 'My mother's experience should be a learning point for so many vulnerable people.'In an advisory on Tuesday, the police warned members of the public about similar scams that targeted bank customers. Besides the aforementioned Viber scam, other variants of the scam had victims getting calls with an automated voice message purportedly from the bank, informing that their bank account had been locked or would be cancelled.Victims were then asked to press a number and the call would be transferred to someone claiming to be a staff member from the bank.Another variant of the scam involved victims receiving an SMS message purportedly from the bank, informing them that their ATM card had been blocked or deactivated.The victims were directed to call a specified number to reactivate their ATM card.The police said that they have received at least 60 reports of such scams since January 2019, with total losses amounting to at least $1.6 million.",

The scammers sometimes also create their own charity names and pretend to be people negatively affected by the fires.Although the Singapore Police Force have not received any locally reported scam cases, the public should remain vigilant, they said.Meanwhile, in another advisory sent out by the police on Tuesday, the police warned of a few new variants of scams targeting bank customers.Since January last year, at least 60 reports of these new variants were made and more than $1.6 million was lost by victims.In the first variant, scammers would call the victims through the Viber messaging app, claiming to be a bank staff member, alleging that the victim's bank accounts had been locked or suspended. They would offer to assist and, in some scenarios, direct victims to a specific WhatsApp number.Alternatively, victims would receive calls with an automated voice message claiming to be from a bank, informing them that their bank account was locked or would be cancelled. They were then asked to call a number and were transferred to someone claiming to be a bank staff member.In another variant of the scam, victims would receive an SMS message supposedly from the bank, informing them that their ATM cards were blocked or deactivated. They were then directed to another number to reactivate their cards. In all these cases, scammers would ask victims for their personal particulars, Internet banking details and one-time passwords.Unauthorised transactions would then be made from their bank accounts.The police advised members of the public to beware of unsolicited messages or calls as scammers may use spoofing technology to mask their identities. The public should not disclose their Internet banking details to anyone via phone, e-mail or SMS. Banks or government agencies will never ask for such information through such channels.The public should also not respond to digital token authentication requests via phone calls if they did not initiate the Internet banking transaction.Should a person receive a suspicious call claiming to be from his bank, he should also verify the authenticity of the call by dialling the number published on the bank's website.For scam-related advice, call the anti-scam helpline on 1800-722-6688 or visit www.scamalert.sgThose who wish to provide information on scams may call the police on 1800-255-0000, or send the information online at www.police.gov.sg/iwitness",

Police said that a licensed moneylender is not allowed to make any cold calls or send unsolicited text messages to members of the public.It is also lawfully obliged to verify the identity and particulars of the borrower at the moneylender's office.A licensed moneylender will also not ask for any payment to be made before a loan is disbursed, or for securing the loan's disbursement. An administrative fee may be charged after the loan has been granted, but this is usually deducted from the loan principal.",

It is fake, said the tech giant.Samsung also warned the public to beware of 'too-good-to-be-true' deals after the fake article on the $3 deal made the rounds online.The Galaxy S10 smartphone, which launched here in March, retails for $1,298.The phone maker told The Straits Times on Tuesday (Sept 24) that it has contacted Facebook to request the removal of any posts on the fake article.A Samsung spokesman said: 'We wish to confirm that this promotion is not organised, authorised or endorsed by Samsung Electronics Singapore and has no relation to us or any of our affiliates.'The article was brought to ST's attention on Monday by a reader. It was 'updated' later in the day to remove any mention of the deal but was back again by Tuesday evening.The fake report claimed that Samsung was working with its distribution partner to give out the Galaxy S10 phones because the company was trying to increase its market share in Singapore. The report also had 'reviews' by satisfied customers who had apparently received their new phones, with one claiming he had 'risked' paying $3 for one because it was less than a cup of coffee.A string of comments left below the article also featured many who praised the deal for being 'amazing' and who claimed that there were 'only 43 (phones) left'.The fake article prompted readers to 'visit the official S$3 Samsung Galaxy S10 promotion' site, which asked visitors for personal details such as their name, home addresses, e-mail addresses, and phone numbers.IT security experts have advised consumers not to enter their personal information into such suspicious sites as cyber crooks could misuse and abuse the data to commit further crimes such as scams.A search online found that similar 'promotions' had circulated in the United States, New Zealand and other countries in previous years, although these largely used Apple's iPhones as bait.Those fake promotions, like the latest Galaxy S10 one, inevitably quoted a Joel Branson as the marketing director giving various explanations on why the company was initiating the time-limited deal.Samsung said on Tuesday that consumers should remain vigilant when encountering these articles as they may result in identity theft or other forms of fraud.•Not sure if something is fake news?

            "Description": "SINGAPORE - Heartbroken after a one-year relationship with a man she met while gaming on the Internet ended, Alice (not her real name) decided to look for love online in July this year.The 43-year-old IT manager met a man on a popular dating app who claimed he was born in Taiwan but was now living in the United States as a diamond dealer.They would chat and call each other every day on messaging platform WhatsApp.'He told me that after his mother died about five years ago, he has been feeling empty and alone, and needed someone in his life,' Alice told reporters on Wednesday (Sept 4) in an interview arranged by the police to warn of online love scams that have seen an uptick.She said he would send her romantic poems every day, and selfies and photos of his life that 'seemed so real', she did not suspect anything was awry.He also asked her several times to be his girlfriend and said he would come to Singapore to meet her, but she declined as she was still healing from her break-up.After just two weeks, the man asked her for a loan of US$5,000 (S$7,000).'He said he had a package of diamonds worth US$800,000 and needed help to pay the custom fees so that the package could reach his clients,' said Alice, who spoke to journalists at the Police Headquarters. Keen to help her online friend, Alice made the transfer via Internet mobile banking to a US bank account under Interaudi Bank.A few days later, he told her that he did not receive the money and asked her to make a second transfer.This time, Alice's suspicions were raised. Without alerting the man, she checked on the status of the transfer with her bank, which confirmed that the transfer was successfully made.Realising that he may not have been telling her the truth, Alice sought advice from her sister. On Aug 20, Alice made a police report after discovering she had been scammed.While she was lucky enough to eventually get back her money after notifying the police, many other victims of Internet love scams are not.In the first half of this year, there were 306 cases of Internet love scams reported to the police, up from the 288 cases in the same period last year.Victims lost a total of $17.1 million - a 46 per cent increase from the $11.7 million in the same period last year.The largest amount cheated in a single case in the first six months of this year was $2.4 million.Principal psychologists Carolyn Misir and Jeffery Chin from the Singapore Police Force said anyone can become a victim of an Internet love scam.Scammers often use compliance and persuasion tactics in order to get victims to transfer money to them, they added.For example, scammers may study their targets and create a fake profile to match what their potential victims may find attractive in a partner.They also try to catch their victims at a time of vulnerability, such as after the loss of a relationship, divorce, or emotional event in their lives, added Ms Misir.In Alice's case, she was savvy enough to be able to pick up on the red flags, said Mr Chin.'All victims of Internet love scams usually would develop suspicions at some point, but most of them don't act on them because they would have to let go of the bond that was formed, so sometimes, they choose not to see the signs,' he added.'It's not just a monetary loss, but the loss of a relationship is akin to the loss of a loved one.'To tackle love scams, police have set up an anti-scam centre that would be able to freeze suspicious bank accounts in the three major banks here - DBS, OCBC and United Overseas Bank.Bank staff have also been trained to spot customers who may be victims of scams.The psychologists said family and friends can also help by keeping an eye out.'Don't make transactions to people you don't know, and don't be afraid to tell someone if you think you may have become a victim,' said Ms Misir.For Alice, her close shave with an Internet love scammer has left her distrustful of others, even in real life.'I'm considered lucky but I've heard other stories where other victims were hurt badly. Don't put too much trust into these online relationships, so you can protect yourself,' she said.",

They were then asked to make repayments.The police advise members of the public to take the following precautions against such scams:- Never give your personal information such as NRIC, SingPass or bank account details to strangers or unverified sources. Do not provide information that is not necessary to make a purchase. - If you suspect that you have received an unknown sum of money in your bank account, report it to the bank and the police immediately. If the money is still in your account, do not make any transactions with it.- Check the track record and background of the company or seller before making a purchase. Be wary that fraud artists can appear and disappear on e-commerce platforms, so the lack of a complaint record is no guarantee of legitimacy.Those who wish to provide information related to such scams can call the police hotline 1800-255-0000, or submit it online at www.police.gov.sg/iwitness.They can also call the National Crime Prevention Council's 'X Ah Long' hotline 1800-924-5664 to give information on unlicensed moneylenders.For scam-related advice, call 1800-722-6688 or visit www.scamalert.sg.",

The police said that WhatsApp users can protect their accounts by enabling the 'Two-Step Verification' feature, which can be found under 'Account' in the 'Settings' tab of the application.In the event that someone has their WhatsApp account taken over by a scammer, they can recover it by signing into the app using their phone number and verification code, which will be sent to their phone.Doing this will also cause the scammer who has taken over the account to be automatically logged out.Members of the public who wish to provide any scam-related information may call the police hotline on 1800-255-0000, or submit the information online at www.police.gov.sg/iwitness",

He then sent the photo to his parents in China, requesting that a ransom be paid to the Chinese bank account for his release.Frightened, the parents transferred 20,000 yuan to the bank account and alerted the teen's guardian, who was in Singapore at the time, as they were unable to get in touch with their son.The guardian then called the police and officers were deployed to find the teen, who was eventually discovered safe in the hotel room.ST understands that the Commercial Affairs Department of the Singapore Police Force is working with its counterparts in China on the case.The police said that they take a serious view against any person who may be involved in scams, whether knowingly or unwittingly.Anyone found to be involved in such scams will be investigated by the police.The police also advised members of the public to ignore unsolicited calls from unknown parties, and ignore the caller's instructions.They added that no government agency instructs people to make payment through a telephone call or social messaging platforms such as WeChat or Facebook.Government agencies also do not ask for personal banking information such as Internet banking passwords.Foreigners who receive calls from people who claim to be police from their home countries should call their embassy or high commission to verify such claims.Members of the public should also refrain from giving out personal information and bank details over the Web or the phone.To seek scam-related advice, members of the public may call the anti-scam helpline on 1800-722-6688 or go to www.scamalert.sg",

            "Description": "An employee of a local trading company received an e-mail last month, seemingly from her director, to transfer US$205,000 (S$277,300) to a business partner in Malaysia.Believing it to be true, she transferred the funds.The transaction drew the attention of OCBC Bank's fraud surveillance unit, as it did not fit the client's usual patterns and the beneficiary was a new payee.OCBC staff alerted the company director, who confirmed that he did not ask for the transfer.The OCBC team then liaised with the Malaysian bank concerned and recovered all the funds by the next morning.For their initiative, the OCBC staff were awarded the Public Spiritedness Award by the Singapore Police Force yesterday at the Police Cantonment Complex.Mr David Chew, director of the Commercial Affairs Department, said the bank had no legal obligation to rectify the scam transaction.'The bank did not have to do this, but it did,' he said. In general, he added, chances of retrieving money that has left Singapore are slim. This case was one of 94 business impersonation scams that took place between January and last month, resulting in losses of $15.8 million - $4.5 million more than the same period last year.Losses from such scams have doubled since 2016, according to figures from the police, rising from $25 million to $57.9 million last year.The highest loss from such a scam this year was at least $4 million.Mr Francisco John Celio, OCBC's head of corporate security, said fraud detection has become more challenging as more customers make digital transactions.That is why OCBC has invested millions of dollars in a fraud surveillance system to monitor transactions in real time, he said, adding that the system can track corporate and consumer transactions across multiple channels, including online banking and ATM transactions.Last year, OCBC recovered roughly $8 million and prevented $20 million worth of fraudulent transactions, the bank said.Police suspect these scammers are hackers who monitor e-mail exchanges between businesses and their suppliers.The hackers then use the information obtained to send payment instructions through 'spoofed' e-mail accounts that closely resemble the suppliers'.Mr Chew said that the commitment and vigilance of financial institutions are 'important weapons in our fight against business impersonation scams'.He also called on businesses to do their part to avoid falling victim to such scams.",

After making the transfer, scammers may no longer contactable.Other frauds on the rise in the first nine months of this year (2018) are: e-commerce scams and China officials impersonation scams.Police said victims lost $1.5 million in e-commerce scams, almost double the $900,000 lost in the same period last year.With China officials' impersonation scams, victims lost $9.1 million, which is about 50 per cent more than the $6 million reported. In these cases, victims will receive calls from people posing as 'China officials' who would demand for their personal particulars, including their passport number and bank account details to settle purported crimes they are accused of committing, include sending parcels containing fake passports or weapons.But one common scam has dropped during this same period: Internet love scams. Victims lost $18.1 million this year, a 40 per cent plunge against the $30.1 million reported.At Friday's event, five remittance companies were given tokens of appreciation for helping the police fight scammers.The companies - AAA Money, Hanshan Money Express, Samlit Moneychanger, Wealthgate International and Zhongguo Remittance - saved customers from losing more than $400,000 to scams in the first nine months this year.Samlit Moneychanger's director Novianti, who goes by one name, helped save a woman from losing $10,000 last month (October).Ms Novianti, 37, said: 'When I asked her who the money was for, she said it was for a man whom she met on WeChat but had never seen in person before.'Ms Novianti informed the Commercial Affairs Department and a police officer came to her shop in Chinatown to inform her about the prevalence of Internet love scams.Samlit Moneychanger helped customers save more than $100,000 from scammers since the start of the year.Said Mr Singham: 'Scammers' traps are getting more devious and sophisticated... Besides huge financial losses, scam victims might suffer intense depression and shame.'",

The photo had been taken off a woman's blog, where she had posted about her new passport last year.The blogger, who wanted to be identified only as Ms Ong, 25, said she had blanked out the IC and passport number.

According to the video, almost all who turned up at the booth leapt at the bargain and filled up a registration form as instructed.The 'sale' was held during a period when many shops were touting massive new year discounts.In the video, a man who wondered if there was return policy for the shoes was told not to worry, and he was seen handing over his cash.Another who asked if was able to skip the registration process was told: 'It's only $30. You're not going to find this anywhere else.'However, he passed up on the offer.The shoppers were then led away to a dark room, where a video on e-commerce scams was screened.Several of them reacted with disbelief when they realised they had fallen for the 'scam'.They then met with Bukit Batok NPC team leader Mohamed Fadzil Mohamed Hisum, who explained that the most number of scams in Singapore involved e-commerce transactions. A majority of the victims were between 22 and 49 years old, he added.Latest police figures released early this year showed that there there were 1,961 cases of e-commerce scams last year, an 8.4 per cent drop from the 2,140 reported in 2016.Victims lost a total of $1.4 million, and the largest amount cheated in a single case last year was $60,700.The Ministry of Home Affairs had said that despite the decrease in the number of e-commerce scams, it remains a source of concern due to the high number of reported cases.

IMDA code against unwanted services Also, in case you were wondering, the authorities do have legislation in place to prevent this from happening to you.In place since 2007, the Code of Practice for Provision of Premium Rate Services governs how these companies can sign up their customers.Under these guidelines, companies have a duty toÂ authenticate the end user for mobile services which may be purchased or subscribed via Internet registration.The companies also need to ensure that they can easily unsubscribe from the service if they choose.MothershipÂ has reached out to some of these companies to find out more about their sign-up processes.The Telcos speak up When contacted, a SingTel spokesperson acknowledged that some customers may have inadvertently subscribed to third-party content.Singtel is assisting them, and have also asked the content providers to temporarily halt their activities. They said that certain guidelines are in place:'For example, we require all content providers to clearly state the charges for each and every transaction. They must also provide a three-step registration process, easy-to-follow instructions on how to unsubscribe and a hotline number to call for assistance.' Singtel said that customers might have still received SMSes from content providers despite already unsubscribing and activating their PRS barring service due to a 'process gap' in updating their information.They added:'We would like to assure customers that once PRS barring has been activated, no additional charges relating to PRS content will be posted to their accounts.' An M1 spokesperson said that they 'thoroughly' investigate every customer feedback, and that it reserved the right to immediately terminate any third-party companies engaged in fraud or abuse.StarHub stated that they would investigate and take appropriate action against errant PRS providers to protect customer interest.It said that both PRS providers and StarHub are required to adhere to IMDA's code, like a mandatory opt-in system for customers, who need to first click through subscription confirmations in order to activate the service, to avoid unwanted subscriptions.Keep a close eye on your next phone bill, and do get in touch with your telco service provider if you find surprise charges suddenly appearing out of nowhere.Top image via YouTube.",

Night spots also saw such cases rising by 33.8 per cent to 107 cases.The police said they will step up patrols at public transportation nodes, and also distribute advisories to commuters during the morning and evening peak hours.Outrage of modesty advisory posters have already been placed on the platform screen doors of MRT stations, and public education videos are being screened at bus interchanges and train platforms, added a spokesman.Victims are advised to lodge reports of outrage of modesty as soon as possible.The crime statistics also show that unlicensed money lending harassment cases rose 12.3 per cent to 3,806 cases last year.But the number of cases involving damage to property as a result of such harassment fell. Police said harassment is now conducted via electronic means involving text messages or e-mails sent to borrowers.Such harassment cases rose by about 33 per cent in 2017, from 2,080 cases in 2016.Internet love scams saw a 29.9 percent increase to 825 cases last year, from 635 reported cases in 2016.The total amount lost by victims also increased by about 50 per cent from $24 million in 2016 to $37 million in 2017. Director of Commercial Affairs Department David Chew said the police will continue to engage the community 'to sensitise the public to the fact that scams can be perpetrated against them anywhere, anytime.'Overall, crime registered a one per cent drop in 2017, from 33,099 cases in 2016 to 32,773 last year.The improvement was largely attributed to two categories - violent/serious property crimes, and theft and related crimes.There was a 12.4 per cent drop in violent/serious property crimes, from 249 cases in 2016 to 218 cases last year.Robberies also declined by 26 per cent - the lowest since 1984. There were 71 cases in 2017 compared to 96 cases in 2016.Deputy Commissioner of Police Tan Chye Hee said the police will continue to work with the community to keep crime at bay.DC Tan said: 'Both overall crime and overall crime rate have decreased for a second consecutive year in 2017... As crimes become increasingly transnational, we must not take our safety and security for granted.'Speaking at the Cybercrime and Anti-Scam campaign roadshow held at Suntec City on Saturday, Mrs Josephine Teo, Second Minister for Home Affairs, said efforts will be stepped up to raise public awareness, and vigilance.At the event, Mrs Teo presented awards to 34 individuals and 12 organisations for their efforts in preventing scams from escalating.",

It is.The scam, which has been circulating on messaging app WhatsApp over the weekend, is the latest involving websites that mimic the airline's branding and look.In an advisory on Sunday (Nov 5), SIA said on its Facebook page and website that it has been receiving public feedback about these phishing sites masquerading as contests organised by the airline.Said SIA: 'It has come to our attention that there are messages, e-mails and phone calls that claim to be from SIA, which inform recipients that they have been selected for a draw or have won air tickets, and then proceed to request their personal data. 'SIA also wishes to advise customers to be cautious of phishing websites that appear similar to the official website and to exercise caution in sharing their personal details online.'SIA told The Straits Times that, since Sunday, members of the public had informed the airline about the scam circulating on WhatsApp.'We explained that the message is not from SIA and that the public should ignore it,' the airline added.Earlier in May, the airline also issued a similar advisory and another one in August, about the prevalence of online scams using websites.In the latest case, the scam appears to play on Singapore Airlines' recent reveal of its new luxury suites on its Airbus A380s, with a picture of the plane on the website.Consumers who open the link will see instructions with grammatical errors and spelling mistakes under the header 'Singapore Airline giving away 2 Firstclass tickets to celebrate it's 45th anniversary! (sic)'Taking part in the fake contest requires contestants to share the link with 20 other friends or groups.The website has since been deactivated and no longer shows the fake promotion. As of Monday, the link has been shared on Facebook more than 50 times.Recipients of such promotions should verify them with SIA and should avoid revealing personal data if they have any doubts, the airline advised, adding that they could lodge a police report as well.",

The seller then asked for a $200 deposit, claiming that he needed it to secure the phone.The seller even sent him a photo of his identity card and driver's licence to secure his trust.Later, the victim read reports that the jet black model of the phone was not available in Singapore and questioned the seller about it.They arranged to meet at Bugis Junction at 3pm on Friday to make the transaction, but the seller could not be contacted from Friday morning onwards.The victim made a police report on Friday evening. He also found other victims who had left messages for the seller online.He told Shin Min there are 15 people who suspect they have been cheated. Most paid deposits of $200 to $400, two paid more than $1,000, and one victim about $4,600.Police said that investigations are ongoing.A quick check of Carousell revealed dozens of iPhone 7 listed for sale, as well as requests to buy the device.",

            "Description": "A 26-year-old freelancer thought she found a good deal when she saw an online offer for an iPad Air 2 at just $400, when this can cost about $900 at Apple's online store.But she ended up forking out a total of $1,000, including payments for various 'fees', for a gadget that was never delivered, after falling prey to an online seller who claimed his shop was in Changi Airport.This was just one of a number of online purchase scams involving electronics stores at Changi Airport. Some sellers claim that their stores are in the airport's transit area, with their inaccessibility making home deliveries of orders necessary. They usually ask for payment upfront, but do not deliver the goods.Mr Leong Chang Woei, operations manager of electronics retailer Sprint-Cass, estimates that there have been 20 cases of such online scams since last October. Sprint-Cass, which runs six electronics outlets under different names in the airport's public and transit areas, does not sell its goods online.Cheats show fake IDs to gain victims' trustA recent bogus site, www.e-gadgetmini.com, used the name of its Terminal 2 shop.'In April or May, there was a spike (in cases), and we updated our Web page with a notice warning consumers to be alert,' said Mr Leong. The trend of online purchase scams involving airport shops is part of a rise in online purchase scams in general.Overall, they increased from 846 cases in the first half of last year to 995 in the same period this year.Mr Leong said online advertisements linked to his shop started appearing on online marketplace Gumtree last October.He said the conmen would show consumers 'identity cards' and 'documents' to back their claims that they were from Sprint-Cass.'People trust them, and a few actually pay them.'Changi Airport Group said it is aware of such scams and has received feedback from a member of public.A spokesman said: 'We work closely with tenants and the police in investigations and would advise customers to exercise prudence in making purchases online.'In the case of the freelancer, who gave her name only as Hui Xian, the seller claimed his shop was on the second floor of Changi Airport's Terminal 3. He asked her to pay an 'insurance and Value-Added Tax fee' totalling $250 on top of the $400 for the iPad Air 2. The $250 was supposedly refundable upon delivery.She told The Straits Times that she transferred money to the seller, and asked for a receipt and tracking number, but received neither.She became suspicious when the seller went on to ask for a 'yellow card fee'of $150 for delivery and a $200 'clearance fee' for Customs.She eventually made a police report. His supposed shop in Changi Airport - 'Vertu Gadget Store'- did not exist.She said there are other electronics sellers online claiming to operate from the airport's transit area and one even sent her photos, supposedly of his identity card and passport, to prove his trustworthiness.A check by The Straits Times showed that the seller does not live at the address on the IC he showed. The unit appears to have been rented out, and his number was 'not available' when ST called.Last week, the seller to whom Hui Xian paid $1,000 challenged her to make a police report, claiming that she lost the money as she had not followed his instructions.His original post is no longer online.When ST called the seller's number, it was not in use.",

It plans to join hands with female advocacy groups to organise events where victims will share their stories either in person or through video recordings.Pamphlets and posters highlighting their experiences will be distributed and put up at Western Union's 12 outlets in Singapore. The company will work with the media to feature the victims in articles and TV news programmes. It will launch the campaign by the end of the year.The police have been working with money transfer companies and banks in recent years to stamp out the problem. At Western Union for example, officers conduct talks with staff members on how the conmen work. The police have also cautioned the public not to fall prey to Internet love scams through news articles and TV shows such as Crimewatch.The number of such cases has fallen. The police told The Straits Times there were 50 Internet love scam victims last year, who were cheated out of $1.2 million. In 2011, there were 62 victims who lost $2.3 million.Western Union vice-president of compliance Jonathan Tan credited the dip to public education efforts by the police. On average, staff members spot one female customer a month remitting money to a boyfriend overseas she met online. About two years ago, they would encounter one case a week.The company's 38 customer service staff have been trained to identify customers who may be potential scam victims. Victims tend to look nervous or will be talking on the phone to get instructions while making the transaction.The staff members will also ask customers questions such as their relationship with the recipient of the cash and will not process the transaction if they find their answers questionable. But Mr Tan said it is getting harder to spot victims as scammers coach them on how to answer the questions.He said: 'Many of the conmen work the same way. By getting the victims to share their stories, we hope that other women will see the similarities in the way the conmen and their so-called boyfriends work to gain their trust and ask them for money.'ameltan@sph.com.sg",

However, none of the buyers received the goods they had paid for and some were even lured to make further payments after being told there were additional delivery costs.Police said that following the spate of cases last September, officers from Jurong Police Division conducted investigations and nabbed the suspect in the vicinity of Jurong West. The suspect is believed to have remitted the money abroad for a percentage of commission from the funds he transferred.Police said personal bank accounts should only be used for personal banking needs. They said anyone who helps another to accept or transfer funds - especially if the source of the funds is unclear - may be aiding and abetting a criminal in receiving the proceeds of crime and may be liable for criminal prosecution.If found guilty of dishonestly receiving stolen property, the suspect can be jailed for up to five years, fined or both. For the offence of transferring benefits of criminal conduct, he could face a fine of up to $500,000, up to seven years' jail, or both.yanliang@sph.com.sg",

Less than $5,000 has been returned.Rumiyati, 40, was sentenced to 16 months' jail yesterday after pleading guilty to nine charges of cheating and two counts of criminal breach of trust, one of them involving about $3,400 of a locker company's money. A further 43 charges involving C&P Rent-A-Car, largely also for cheating, were taken into consideration.Her clients included various government agencies such as the Singapore Armed Forces and the Public Utilities Board.She would key in agencies as customers to book the vehicles and then fabricate excuses in each month's statement of accounts to explain why the clients had not paid.Rumiyati was caught after leaving C&P Rent-A-Car, when her successor took over her accounts and started contacting the agencies to settle the debts purportedly owed.District Judge Victor Yeo said Rumiyati's crimes were serious and the amounts involved were not small.He said the number of charges clearly showed Rumiyati had not acted on the spur of the moment but with careful premeditation.Deputy Public Prosecutor Kenneth Chin told the court she had taken steps to avoid detection for the offences, committed over a period of almost two years.Rumiyati's lawyer said his client is a divorcee with four young children, and is suffering from stage two breast cancer.He said she committed the offences not for personal gain but to support her family.However, Judge Yeo agreed with the prosecution that Rumiyati's financial hardship was hardly a mitigating factor.For each count of cheating her former employer to hand over its property, she could have been jailed up to 10 years and fined.pohian@sph.com.sg",

Soriano, 30, also conned his ex-girlfriend into believing that he had been held captive and needed money to be paid for his release. He duped her into transferring $10,000 to his bank account.He pleaded guilty last week to 19 o f 70 charges. The total amount involved in all the charges is $39,386.Thirty-four victims were deceived into transferring money to his bank accounts or paying him cash for limited-edition G Shock watches, Gundam watches or figurines which he claimed he had for sale.Deputy Public Prosecutor Charis Low told the court that Soriano left Singapore for Thailand in May 2013. While in Hat Yai in August that year, he accessed M1's Message Centre at an Internet cafe.Purporting to be a kidnapper, he sent text messages to Ms Wong Yee Poh's mobile phone stating that he had been kidnapped and demanded ransom money for his release.He told the her to deposit the ransom money into his POSB bank account . Each time she did that, Soriano - pretending to be the kidnapper - would send text messages to her claiming that he had been released but then recaptured.He would then send her more text messages demanding further payments for his release.Ms Wong lodged a police report on Dec 3 that year that she had transferred money to Soriano as he had purportedly been kidnapped.Soriano was arrested at Changi Airport on July 15 last year.He was on police bail pending further investigation when he committed a series of Internet sales scams.Investigations showed that he had devised a scam to cheat people into transferring money to his bank accounts.From August 2014 to March this year, he posted advertisements on websites and applications such as www.gumtree.com and www.hardwarezone.com and Carousell, claiming to have various items such as Gundam figurines and G-Shock watches for sale.He used a variety of Carousell accounts to perpetuate the scam and avoid detection.Subsequently, when his OCBC Bank account was frozen by the bank as police reports had been lodged, he started using the bank accounts of seven friends, one of whom lent him two accounts. He told them that his own bank account had been frozen and he needed to receive his salary from his employer or money from other friends.Soriano, who made partial restitution of $6,303, could have been jailed for up to 10 years and fined on each charge.",
